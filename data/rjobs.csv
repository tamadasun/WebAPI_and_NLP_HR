jobs,"""Mass layoffs are in store for 2024, and it might end up affecting nearly half of companies, according to a new poll.

That's the latest information from a Resume Builder survey, based on responses from more than 900 companies this month. Resume Builder is a professional platform that allows users to create resumes in just a few steps.

In the survey, nearly four in 10 companies said they are likely to have layoffs in 2024, prompting increased fears of a recession around the corner. More than half of companies also said they plan to implement a hiring freeze in 2024.

When asked why the companies were engaging in the layoffs, half said the anticipation of a recession was a reason. Meanwhile, a little less, four in 10 said they are going to lay off employees and replace workers with artificial intelligence (AI).""

jobs,"For the past two years things have changed a lot at my job. First of all, it’s a male dominated work force and I (34F) am a woman so it’s always been harder to get people to take me as seriously that’s just the reality of it. Management has changed a lot as well and people are taking new roles so my relationship with certain people have changed from coworker to supervisor etc. I say this because a coworker I considered a friend is now a site supervisor and he’s now very cold towards me.

I work in an industrial workplace in the environmental department (the only environmental person at this site) and my role is to enforce permit compliance. At times this means telling my higher ups or other workers that we are doing something we shouldn’t and stopping work to correct it so we are in compliance. This is always a hassle to others (they make that clear) because my role is to support and they consistently try to say I am trying to run the company and cause issues. I have talked to my immediate boss and supervisor and they are in the loop and know that I am doing exactly what I am supposed to be doing and I am not overstepping. I asked them this because I started to question myself. I am constantly being told I am doing things I shouldn’t be, or causing issues or overstepping but I always run these situations by my bosses and they are on my side. 

The issue now is this: we expanded our office building because we were crammed in. I have been sharing an office with Safety for 5 years. With the expansion, they moved people around. I jokingly (but seriously) said to my environmental bosses “how much you want to bet that I will be the only full time person without an office.” I said this because there will be cubicle areas for random visitors but also because I’m always shafted. They sent out the seating chart today: I am the only full time employee with no office and I’m in a cubicle. The thing that makes me even more annoyed is that they have two offices open “for visitors.” 

I feel like at this point it’s becoming an HR issue. Any woman that’s been hired besides myself has left as soon as possible because they quickly hate it. Our intern this summer on her exit interview told HR how much she noticed that people wouldn’t take me seriously or ignore me and my male boss would say the same thing I did but they would do it for him.

jobs,"Hey everybody, I’m a first gen college student living in a rual area, so I don’t have access to a lot of resources. Hopefully reaching out here will help! I pick my major in two weeks, and have reached out to several forums about careers I’m interested in, only to receive overwhelmingly negative feedback. At this point I feel so discouraged, and I’m not sure if there is a career out there for me. I just was wondering if there was a career you would think I would be successful in based off my personality, strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. 

Personality type: infj

My strengths: 
One thing I know is that I have a good work ethic, and I am willing to put in the time. I have been working two jobs while being in college full time, which has not been easy. I especially work hard if there is a purpose in doing so, such as helping someone else. I have also worked very hard for my spot on honors society

I am good at problem solving, and I can hyper focus if it is interesting 

Despite being an introvert, I have been told I am good with people and always understand them very well (not saying it’s true though😂)

My weaknesses:

I get overwhelmed at times, especially in large crowds and under extreme pressure. 

I have adhd, I don’t use it as an excuse, but you can probably imagine that it comes with weaknesses. 

What I am looking for in a career:

- good work\life balance 
- ability to help others (while not getting burnt out as an introvert)
- decent pay
- flexibility 
- relatively low stress, but I can tough it out if need be

Obviously I know no career has all these!!!

jobs,"I work for a manufacturing company in the warehouse.

I'm quiet, I work extremely hard, I was the top percentage every month and got recognized by management.

I applied for an entry manufacturing position.. which I didn't get with no experience.. but got offered a packing position for specified products in manufacturing that need quality control (With promise of future training)

Problem is.. I get my work done in half the day. The position seems unnecessary since I'm working with someone who was already doing it. There is no opportunity for extra cleaning since it's a dirt-controlled environment and cleaning is only at end of day. Stock/Inventory is all management. My position partner seems content burning time and walking around talking all day.. and they seem in no way ready to let them go and enable this behavior throughout the company.

Ive been doing this for about 4-5 months now banging my head... I have ZERO management and its a problem throughout the department.

I pride myself (and need personally) to stay busy and work hard.  
I've tried to ask for extra work and training opportunities but I'm just told there's nothing available.

Now with evaluations coming up.. I'm getting the feeling they're going to use this as excuses to keep me in position without pay incentives....

What should I do? Going back to warehouse is also now unavailable do to staff hirings..

Please know I'm truly trying to be busy doing anything all day... not for personal lack of trying...

jobs,"As title says, I graduated this year with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I know the market for entry jobs is kinda dead right now but I'm still trying not to lose hope. Last year I took part in a DevOps internship and that's the only work experience I have. However, I'm not set on any specific field, I would gladly start out in any branch, DevOps, Front-End etc. ATM I guess I am only supposed for the next internships intake and try my best to land something there, but I am going to move next summer/autumn in another country in EU as my long-term bf is going to start his PhD, and that also complicates things a bit as I wouldn't be able realistically to hold a on-site job here in my country even if I would find a job in the meanwhile. Since graduating, I've been doing Coursera certs (front-end from meta atm) trying to get something more to put in my CV. I also get a lot of pressure from my parents due to my hopefully temporary unemployment, and tbh another reason I need a job asap is to just be able to get my own pocket money, so honestly I would be happy with even the lowest of lows regarding salaries. I also feel like Uni didn't teach me enough skills to get a job after graduating without needing to do something extra. **But I have that feeling that even though I might think I am doing my best atm I might actually be not and I could be doing something even better to improve my situation.** So cue the following questions I have:  
1. Are remote entry jobs in the EU a real, feasible thing? And if so, would you be able to recommend some less unknown job portals that might assist me in finding such a job?  
2. What else could I be doing while job hunting? Projects, courses etc. ?

I was laid off from my previous company and found a new job. I quickly accepted because it was close to my previous wage and I was very anxious about being unemployed and people not hiring near the holidays/end of the quarter. 

I started this job a little over a month and a  half ago and I have continually regretted it since. 

First of all I was hired for a specific position within our team and on the first day told I would be training in a different one (one I have no interest in and would have declined the job if I would’ve know). This is due to staffing changes and such. 

Training has been ok but I feel as though I am not a good fit for the position or team. I have also learned I am getting about 1/2 the time previous people have to get trained and 2 of those weeks were at the lowest operating level due to holidays. There are some other issues with the position as well and management that have turned me off from the company/team.

So, I actually like my job but have admittedly more recently taken to comparing myself to a former peer (I graduated from high school in June) who is majoring in a field that I know tends to lead to people making a lot of money. I make $17 hourly and start working more often in January when my job returns from our break, have $6,000 saved up from this semester where I was working part-time (full 7 hours Monday and Wednesday, 2 hours on Tuesday or Thursday sometimes, 6 hours on a Friday sometimes.) I have been added to my job’s staff group chat in part because they’ll be seeing me more often soon. But it’s like I care about who will end up making more money in the long run all of a sudden even though I had promised myself that over break I was just going to relax, and that this year I was going to try going with the flow and taking community college courses while working to sort of try to get a feel for what I see myself doing. I have a 3.67 GPA so far, am still waiting on one professor to post scores. I started on July 31st. 

One of my coteachers suggested she started as a substitute and is now a full time teacher (but doesn’t have a degree yet, a lot of my coworkers don’t.)

jobs,"# Context

I've been on the job hunt recently (Sr. Devops Engineer and Engineering Manager roles) and have been using my custom iCloud email address ([me@firstnamelastname.com](mailto:me@firstnamelastname.com)) on the job boards I've been applying on.

My experience is fairly good (\~7 years total) and I think my resume is pretty good. It has all of the keywords I think are useful, highlights my impact and not just projects, etc.

# Problem

I've applied for roughly 40 jobs over the last month, and I've barely had any leads. All of my leads come right from LinkedIn or my network. What makes me think my email address might be the problem is that I applied for a job that my friend works at and he told me that, when trying to send me a calendar invite from his HRIS system, it flagged my custom email address as invalid. The recruiter confirmed with me that my email address had no typos, but his system just didn't like it.  


I offered him my alternative email ([firstlast@fastmail.com](mailto:firstlast@fastmail.com)), and everything worked fine.

&amp;#x200B;

These are standard questions but I think I just snapped. Apparently, I was “overqualified” so they wanted to sus out why I was applying for said job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the job so I can have MONEY to pay bills. That. Is. It. I wouldn’t apply to your stupid job if I could get calls back from the positions that over 300+ other people in my field have applied to. Plus, I could do literally everything listed in the job description so why wouldn’t I apply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"Hi everyone.

Coming up on 2 years at my current role working in financial compliance/auditing. I am entering my mid 20's, and I currently make like $56,500 ish a year. 

I have a degree in Finance with a minor in Economics. I have been working since I was 16, but my main 2 jobs/backgrounds have been 3.5 years in cellular sales, and 2 years in financial compliance/auditing.

My current role is very stagnant (most people in my role have left around the 1-2 year mark, as there isnt growth internally and yearly raises are very minimal, and my position does not offer bonuses). My team is very small, under 10 people.

I am considering going to get my CIA (Certified Internal Auditor) certification, as that should immediately bump my pay and make me a more ""preferred"" candidate in the world of auditing.

But I'm just wondering... how can I break out of the 55-65k range and shoot up into the 80k's? Is it me? Lack of ""experience"" or lack of credentials? I'm open to exiting auditing, but I'd rather not go back into sales.

jobs,"It's no secret that the job market has done a complete 180 since the chaotic days of the COVID pandemic. Remember ""The Great Resignation"" when jobs were abundant, and quitting was in vogue? Well, times have changed once again, and it's time to face the new reality without the rose-colored glasses.

**The Great Resignation Hangover: Toxic Apathy and Bad Advice**

During the pandemic, there were more job opportunities than there were people to fill them. The concept of work became a punching bag, and employees started pushing the boundaries of the traditional employer-employee relationship. High salaries, remote work, and quitting toxic jobs were celebrated as the new norm. But as we step into 2023, that narrative needs a serious adjustment. Those boundaries have been there for a reason, and until COVID, have withstood the test of time.

**The Harsh Reality of 2023: The Job Market's Never Been Worse**

The job market isn't just in a slump; it's worse than ever. And no, this isn't a temporary dip; it's a seismic, structural shift. White-collar jobs are disappearing thanks to AI and offshoring, with the latter being the more impactful force. If you're still holding onto popular advice from 2021, it's time to wake up and smell the harsh reality of 2023.

**The New Normal: Company Loyalty and Ethical Job Hunting**

Job hopping was briefly acceptable during the pandemic chaos. Now, it's considered unethical. Your employer took a chance on you, especially if they hired you when you were desperate. Taking a job without the intention of making your career there is now once again considered a breach of ethics. Those that continue to job hop are going to pay the piper when they start getting turned down for their shaky work history. Companies are once again adopting the mantra of ""if they'll cheat with me, they'll cheat on me.""

**Remote Work: A Fleeting Fantasy**

Remote work was a brief fad that peaked during the pandemic. It was never meant to be permanent. It's time to reassess your expectations and prepare to work 100% on-site.

**Respect for Employers: A Forgotten Virtue**

During the pandemic, it felt like everyone was more focused on planning their exit than finding ways to navigate a toxic work environment. With exit opportunities disappearing, it's time to shift focus back to surviving and progressing within your current job, just like in the old days. Even if it's a toxic work environment, the ""new old normal"" is to find ways to survive and even thrive within one employer. Most people stayed with bad employers thanks to the social unacceptability of job hopping.

**Back to the Future: Regressing to 1980s Social Norms**

The world of work is quickly regressing to 1980s social norms. Globalization means tougher work standards from other cultures such as India are being introduced to the US, and we need to adapt. It's tough love, but those who accept this reality and start following these norms will have an easier time in our brave new (or not so new) world.

Let's quit complaining, adjust our expectations, and face the new realities of the job market in 2023. Company loyalty &amp; respect is back in style, and it's time to jump on the bandwagon or be left behind.

I want to work as like analyst or something of the sort until I can do my own thing, but I’d like to get experience. But getting a interview let alone a job offer has been impossible.

jobs,"Hi everyone! Just a dilemma i’m in that I have a question about:

So I have a “job” as an RA at my university. I say that with quotations because I want to quit it. I don’t get paid, only a scholarship. It goes directly to my tuition; there is no option for me to have it sent to me unless it was money left over. I’m also not able to work a work-study job because I’d basically be “double-dipping”. 
It’s also a lot of work I have to do, which I wasn’t informed of in the application. The scholarship that I get is not worth it. 

So, I want to quit and get an actual job so I can make money during the semester. But if I do, I’d lose about $2,000 and would have to pay that back for this upcoming semester.

Now, the problem i’m honestly most worried about in all of this is that I work at a summer camp from the end of may to the start of august. It keeps me afloat for the most part during school.

jobs,"I am hiring for a manager level role (without people management) and can’t decide between two candidates. The job requires data analytical skills, business relationship management, strong excel skills, and experience.

Candidate 1:
- More junior. Has 6 years of somewhat related experience but only 1 year of directly relatable experience.
- An awesome personality I really connected with. Would be awesome managing relationships.
- Wants to learn as much as possible for career growth, not necessarily needing a promotion soon.
- Has a degree in math, so even though not many years of experience, I think can pick up data analysis and excel easily.
- well written resume
- could hire as a lower level with hopes of promoting later but I really prefer manager level to alleviate my workload.

Candidate 2:
- 4 years of directly relevant experience plus 2 years of somewhat related. The stronger candidate in terms of doing the work and would be less of learning curve.
- has been promoted before
- resume is clear but for some reason some responsibilities are in paragraph form while others as bullets (attention to detail/ presentation)
- somewhat reserved, not a strong connection during interview. May need pushing to be connected to internal teams.

- could hire as a lower level with hopes of promoting later but I really prefer manager level to alleviate my workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candidate 2:
- 4 years of directly relevant experience plus 2 years of somewhat related. The stronger candidate in terms of doing the work and would be less of learning curve.
- has been promoted before
- resume is clear but for some reason some responsibilities are in paragraph form while others as bullets (attention to detail/ presentation)
- somewhat reserved, not a strong connection during interview. May need pushing to be connected to internal teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else being equal.

jobs,"To put it bluntly, I was fired from my job this month. It really sucked because it was right before Christmas but I can't say I didn't see it coming. I was an emotional wreck for a day or two but I've definitely come back to grips with reality and have put in dozens of job applications ever since.

So how should I handle this topic, if and when it is brought up during screening/interviews? For context, I was employed over 2 years with that company and it really wasn't a very good fit (toxic work culture, insane work hours, meticulous boss) so in a way I'm super happy I'm not there anymore, just wish the departure was on my terms rather than theirs. My ex-boss was a new manager and was constantly breathing down my neck about assignments, he micromanaged the living heck out of me. This being said, it was not a conducive work environment and a bad fit between me and him. Starting 2 months ago, he started reprimanding me over the littlest of things (not following verbal directions to a ""T"", not doing things perfectly to code). And he documented all of this behind the scenes, which is how he got me fired.

This being said, how do I word this so I don't look like a complete fool? I'm usually a pretty concise person during interviews and have confidence I should be able to play it off smoothly. I was thinking something along the lines of:

Graduated from big 12 school Dec 2020.
Job history below:

Jan 2021-Jan 2023: Logistics Account Executive - TQL (Total Quality Logistics)
*** I “quit”on good terms aka “rehire possible” &amp; think I can do reference with boss. We’re cool - I’ve crashed on his couch drunk before.

Feb 2023 - Present: Account Manager - don’t feel comfortable disclosing. “Big” company in terms of market share in their industry - but smaller environment. Typical capital group bought this company out and hired chief executives to run it and gain value to sell in future.

I don’t want to do sales. First job was $40/k a year pretax and about $10-12k in commission in my career there.

This job is a raise - $50k/year. Estimated earning $65k, but like MOST sales jobs - that’s not the case. Annual take home estimate - $55-60k

———

I’m in Cincinnati OH &amp; available for in person/remote jobs. What do you suggest?

The pros are my degree &amp; work history. Hidden pros that they won’t know until I start working - very hard work ethic.

Sales is only worth it when you’re making six figures. When you’re not, it’s just a lot of work which impacts mental health as I do value work life balance.

Even when you’re doing well in sales,it could flip. My skills I’ve gained through sales are relevant - communication, organization, I can close accounts, I have a good grasp on the business world.

——

What do I want to do? I want to own several businesses and manage them. I’m 26. I do t have that money.

I make good money from the overtime but it’s hard to enjoy my time off as I am exhausted when I come home and I can’t really relax when I am on call. I also have an additional job that I am required to work at once a month, usually on a weekend day as I work five weekdays a week. This makes it difficult to do traveling and/or family things and has severely affected my sex life. I also have to work two major holidays a year. My primary job starts at five am so I have to go to sleep early which I struggle to do. I have to do all my chores when I get home, get food, exercise, and by the time I am done doing all that I have like an hour to myself. 

My partner is very into his sport and travels to play it often and I enjoy going with him when I can. Yet, my job will not let me take off if I don’t have enough PTO and only one person can be off work at a time. This makes it very difficult for me to travel with him and see my family. 

His family owns a business and said they’d be very happy to have me work for them. This job would be completely remote, have extremely flexible working hours, and I would get to actually see my partner. The catch is that I would make 20-25k less a year. Yet, my health insurance would be free and I wouldn’t have to do my 30 mile commute every day. The flexibility would be amazing for me to be able to not only do the things I need to do everyday but also would give me the ability to actually see my family.

hi! I recently interviewed for a position with a pretty big and well-known company. last monday, I got a call from the director i had interviewed with that they had filled the position internally, but that there was another position open that I might be interested in. she sounded almost…apologetic that they’d filled the position internally and told me numerous times that I interviewed very well. the other position is in the same department and same position with different title (manager vs coordinator)

I applied for the new position that night and emailed her to thank her. I guess I am curious about what the next steps might be? should I be prepared to interview again, even though the job description is the exact same that i’ve already interviewed for? I don’t want to be overly confident but it feels like a good thing that she told me about this other position, right?

I’ve been reading job advices from Reddit a lot, but I never found myself in the situation where I need advise, so it’s my first time 🙃
I’m 24 years old. I worked for 1 year for a big oil corporation. It was my first job and overall it was a good experience, but I wanted to leave since I realized the job I was doing there was a career dead end, with no possibility to learn something and apply it elsewhere but in the oil industry. So I applied for a finance job in a big marketing agency. The job was remote, but they sell the job well and I thought it would be a good career shift. I took the offer. I’m two months in and I realized I HATE spending my entire day alone at home. Before taking the job I thought about this, but I was not sure because I never tried working from home and I saw lots of benefits, like avoiding travel time, lunch costs and having more time to do my stuff. Nevertheless, I realized non of these things is enough to compensate the lack of interaction with other people. (Lesson number 1: trust my intuition) 
Should I start applying to other jobs? Should I wait for another 4 months? Have any of you guys had a similar experience? If I get an offer for an interview, what should I say about my reasons for wanting to leave? What do you think?

So, update, that I got a job! WHOOP WHOOP! But I am a little concerned.

I got hired on the spot after a guy in HR called me and asked if I can work asap. I said sure as I've been looking for a job since late October. I applied on Indeed and they were only taking applications through Indeed, which I thought was odd, but simply ignored it. This is was yesterday, 12/26.

Fast forward with today, 12/27, I asked about paperwork as I have no login info to a website or anything. They said that would get a contract signed up and speed the process as soon as I send my ID. For some reason, my scam radar is going feral. I asked if I could see the contract after sending my ID over, but haven't gotten a response yet. I only sent them my email and no personal info.

So tell me reddit, is this normal or is my radar correct and should tell this ""HR"" employee to gently GTFO?

I asked if I could see the contract after sending my ID over, but haven&amp;#39;t gotten a response yet. I only sent them my email and no personal info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So tell me reddit, is this normal or is my radar correct and should tell this &amp;quot;HR&amp;quot; employee to gently GTFO?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: UPDATE. I called the store and confirmed with a manager and assistant. They are hiring for that store and to not ask for SSN is normal. I was overthinking it.&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"I applied to a job on indeed. It's office work which I can do.I received an email, ""can you send me your references so I can start processing your application.""

I. I never spoke with this person

2. I have not had an interview 

3. I don't know what the job pays

It's for a paralegal-legal assistant job. I've applied to this firm before. So it is likely they have turnover issues. 

I'm going to reply with, ""In my experience, having an interview to determine the fit, and compensation, and if there is a mutual interest is the right sequence before contacting my references.""

My prior employers use The Work Number. My last job was in March 2023. That employer began outsourcing so my boss isn't even there. That's why many companies use The Work Number.

Has anyone had an employer want the names and phone numbers of references without an interview or knowing the pay?

I'm in TN, and they do things differently here, and employers don't like assertive people from the North asking questions. But my questions are based on my strong experience in the business world. I'm not entry level in my knowledge base, BUT this job is entry level.

Now that I think about it, they might want someone who doesn't have my prior training, managing and leadership skills. They want me to come in with a very subordinate mindset.

I have an interest in law, and a Masters. I have a growth mindset. So when I apply to get into an organization, they are interviewing me for a position that is several steps backwards. (mentally) I can do the tasks. And this is where I get rejected.

Because most women apply to jobs that they meet 100% of the qualifications and men will apply to ones that they meet 60%. I keep getting stuck in jobs that keep me down, because the female bosses want you to progress according to their sequence. 

In TN it goes according to their pace. And because I can learn fast, think fast and work fast, and I have a strong intellectual interest in law, I will have to compartmentalize what I know from my prior work and box it in for this role.

If the hiring manager sees based on my conversation or confidence level that I've held higher positions, they might feel intimidated and turn me down. 

We never discuss cultural differences here, but that does exist in the U.S.A. I am mindful but I am who I am.

Its like being a 5th grade teacher and a student from 10th grade comes in and you want them to think at that level.

And that is why it is difficult for some of us to get back into the workforce when jobs ask for 1 to 5 years experience.

jobs,"Hi all, 
I wanted to share my recent story to get some views on it. At the end of November of this year (2023) I was ""let go without cause"" from a Director position a held at a community health service for 1.5 years. 

I had a bit of a unconventional progression to that position. I only started my career in health services in 2017 after graduating from a 2 year community college diploma. My employers over the last few years saw great leadership potential and I quickly found myself in managerial roles. When I went to the place I got fired from, I entered as a manager and was promoted to director after 8 months of strong work. I had great working relationships with my senior leaders and the 150+ staff that reported to me in my division. I never missed a deadline, had a performance issue, or anything. I would say the only thing that created uncertainty about me was my age in comparison to my younger counterparts, it's something my CEO would always refer to. I'm also now 30 years old.

TBH the reason I got fired escaped me for awhile, but I think it was a misinterpretation of something I did. I had been given a project to transition some tenants from a house and set them up in new accommodations so we could sell the house they were in, I was given a ridiculously short deadline of 4 weeks to make it all happen and we did. On the moving day we had contracted a moving service - they did great work and had to be paid of course. I was working from home that day and left my manager and her team to oversee the move, but when it came time for paying the vendor, they claimed they couldn't accept electronic funds or credit payments so we had to come up with $350+ in cash. I couldn't ask my manager or frontline workers to front this so I went there myself, withdrew the cash from my account and paid the movers - job done... I figured I'd just claim it on my expenses. I didn't go to any of the worksites or interact with any of the staff or clients, however my bosses were aware I was sick and WFH that day. Of course in healthcare, COVID scares are still strong sooooo when I come in Monday, half way through the day I was served my termination papers and escorted out of the building. 

It really sucked, as I felt like I did so much for the company to the point where Ive fronted operational expenses on multiple occasions (never again). I get it, as a director I should have led by example and not show up to work - but I felt it was for a good reason to pay our vendors. Overall I dont know if this was the true reason, as I wasn't given one at the point of termination. 

Anyhow... I start a new job today. It has a 10k pay cut and a drop in title to ""senior manager"" but the organization seems ok. I desperately took this job to be able to keep income coming, but I also believe in the good of the program and operation I've been hired to lead. My current employer tells me that they only ask for at minimum 1 year of commitment to the role, knowing that my skills and competency exceeds the value of the position; I found this very courteous. 

I deeply fear not having the opportunity to climb the career ladder again. Not only because healthcare is taxing and only senior management and up positions really earn good money, but I also am not competitive in the job market with a 2 year diploma. I have a plan to go back to school to finish a BA and put some more work into my breathwork business but as I begin my new role, I can't help but feel hopeless that I'm stuck in this rat race in a low paying industry and if I don't get opportunities like the ones I've cultivated at previous employers then I'll never be able to live my ideal life (house and kids).

I wanted to share my recent story to get some views on it. At the end of November of this year (2023) I was &amp;quot;let go without cause&amp;quot; from a Director position a held at a community health service for 1.5 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of a unconventional progression to that position. I only started my career in health services in 2017 after graduating from a 2 year community college diploma. My employers over the last few years saw great leadership potential and I quickly found myself in managerial roles. When I went to the place I got fired from, I entered as a manager and was promoted to director after 8 months of strong work. I had great working relationships with my senior leaders and the 150+ staff that reported to me in my division. I never missed a deadline, had a performance issue, or anything. I would say the only thing that created uncertainty about me was my age in comparison to my younger counterparts, it&amp;#39;s something my CEO would always refer to. I&amp;#39;m also now 30 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBH the reason I got fired escaped me for awhile, but I think it was a misinterpretation of something I did. I had been given a project to transition some tenants from a house and set them up in new accommodations so we could sell the house they were in, I was given a ridiculously short deadline of 4 weeks to make it all happen and we did.

jobs,"I have been pondering this question for some time now and I wanted to get some thoughts from the public here, because I cannot think of a solution. 

Some background: I moved to Europe 10 years ago and got a bachelor's degree in psych. During my student years, I have been working odd jobs, like cleaning houses and offices, working in fast food, working as a sales lady at clothing stores, etc. After getting the degree, I realised that the huge responsibility for someone's mental health (being a therapist) is not something I would like to have. I just don't want to mess up a person's life more by accidentally saying one wrong thing, yknow? I have done internships in the field as well working with different kinds of people (seniors with psych problems, teenagers in difficult home situations, deaf kids at school,...), but nothing clicked with me. Now I am working with babies and young kids, but because I am so sensitive to stimuli, I think I will have to give up the job soon. 

That leads us to today. I have been pondering of diving into the thing that scares me the most: doing something with my art. When I think about this, it's what makes sense to me. I see myself doing this for the rest of my life. Of course it's going to be difficult at times, but the fact that it's a low stimulus job and, if I am a freelance artist, I have the choice to work from home and be my own boss (more or less). The thing is, I have always seen this as a hobby and have no formal schooling to show for. It's only recently that I am considering doing something serious with this. I can't dive right in with this because I don't even have a portfolio and I need money, of course, to pay the bills. Visual and narrative storytelling is something I really want to pursue, but it will take years to hone this craft. I am 30 years old and do not have the luxury of being a full time student again. 

So Reddit, I was wondering if you can help me. What job would you recommend me doing instead of working at daycare? What job can teach me skills that might be useful for my future endeavour?

How do people get over the fear to take a new leap?  I’ve researched and the new company has TONs of opportunity for growth.  Downsides is I’d have to drive 2x a week 45-55 min instead of 15 min like my current job.  But I’d get an extra WFH day, no on call, no management… and they know I need more training in specific areas and seem willing.&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"I currently work in customer service. 
I hate it. 
It's just what I got into after I dropped out of school and I stuck to it almost 10 years later.
I hate the phone side of things but do enjoy the rest of it. I've always excelled in every role I've ever had, I stayed with this job as my manager basically promised a promotion but then HR decided to hire externally and gave the job to someone with 15 years experience. In a different field. So no actual experience in our job role and I've basically had to train them, feels like a slap in the face. 

I've just turned 27 and I'm now doing an access course so I can get into uni - although I still have no idea what I want to do.

I hate it. 
It&amp;#39;s just what I got into after I dropped out of school and I stuck to it almost 10 years later.
I hate the phone side of things but do enjoy the rest of it. I&amp;#39;ve always excelled in every role I&amp;#39;ve ever had, I stayed with this job as my manager basically promised a promotion but then HR decided to hire externally and gave the job to someone with 15 years experience. In a different field. So no actual experience in our job role and I&amp;#39;ve basically had to train them, feels like a slap in the face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just turned 27 and I&amp;#39;m now doing an access course so I can get into uni - although I still have no idea what I want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

There is no way to space out work or keep it for a rainy day due to deadlines. I'm too new to have enough responsibilities to just get myself busy or send useless mails.

Usually I can somehow manage to wait it out untill I either catch my supervisor and beg for work, but now everyone is on vacation.

&lt;p&gt;I think all of this is just pointing to career/job/life burnout. I am not happy at all and honestly just feel either numb, sad, overwhelmed, or frustrated/angry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no desire to keep learning or start my own business or do really anything. I am just so tired and want to stop. &lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"Hey Everyone! I just joined to this community, because, as the title says, i can't quit my current job and really don't know, what to do. I'm from Hungary, so apologies about my english, i'll do my best writing all of this down. :)

So i'm working on a gas station, near the border, for 9 years now. We are a gas station, but it's more like a door to Hungary for people, with a biig big shop, where people can buy everything for their trips, tolls for the highway, food, coffee, we are giving information about everything, helping them out, as we can do, etc etc... We are working in weekly shifts, from tuesday, to tuesday, in 12 hours a day and because we are a non-stop shop, there are night and day shifts too. 12 employees working at this company.

Basically, we got two bosses, one, who owns this whole sh*t (she's living on the other side of Hungary, she's basically never here) and one, who runs the shop. We have an outstanding trafic in this shop, basically, the whole Balkans stopping at us, to take a breath, drink a coffee, go to the toilet, or just hang out, before moving on towards the western countries.

...and my problems are starting here.

People are too much for me now. I loved to be with people everyday, but for now, it is too much. Especially this much people, who are at us everyday. Sometimes, i got to do 2-3 peoples work too, because i'm the young one in the shift, my lengs aren't hurting, i'm not fat, yet i got ambition, i'm not embittered, etc etc. Literally, i'm moving up and down the whole day, when i'm working and sometimes, it isn't enough. When i make a 5 minutes break, they always calling me to do something, not talking about, that my boss constatly watches the cctvs from home, keeping us in under control.

I'm getting back home exhausted everyday, can't speak normally with my family, with my girlfriend, my life is just on hold, because i don't have enough energy to move it forward, the salary isn't even enough, to start a life with my girlfriend...
Considering my education, i'm a system administator, and a self educated photographer for 4 years now. I love doing it, but often I don't feel like it or have the energy for it because of my work. This isn't my life anymore, never truly was, i met amazing people over the years, can't say, that all of these people were only boring, but i'm exhausted and really don't know, how can i resume everything in these two interests...

I would now need three months of unemployment to pull myself together, because in this state I would not be able to fit into a new job, but i'm too afraid of the uncertain.

What can i do in this situation?

Just want advice on if I should reapply or not as I feel like I can do better on my cover letter. Any advice? I also recognize it’s the holidays so things are slower around this time.&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"A little back story: born and raised in the US but lived in Canada for about 2 and a half years (moved back here to the same area in June). I left the last company I worked for prior to moving on really great terms it was just they couldn’t keep me on the payroll while I was over the border. They said if I needed anything to let them know. 

In the two and a half years that I lived there I had a couple of jobs that are on my resume because a) they fill the gap and b) they’re relevant experience. When I moved back, I reached out to a friend I knew who still worked there and she was like “I got you.” I put in my resume on their site along with a cover letter explaining how I used to work there and have moved back to the area for good. In the meantime I was still putting in applications elsewhere. A month goes by and I haven’t heard anything from anyone at the place I used to work at so I just thought they had no spots available at this time. 

In August I took a job at a coffee chain to get me out of the house and give me some time to figure out things. This is where life took a weird turn. A couple of weeks ago my old boss shows up to get coffee on the way back from a trip and recognizes me behind the counter. He goes “you should reach out to me I’ll give you my info” and I respond with “I put in a whole application and didn’t hear anything.” He sits down to drink the coffee I just made him and after a bit he tells me that the outside talent acquisition company they used disregarded my resume because they saw I worked in Ontario and didn’t think I was eligible to work in the US. 🙄 The company also went through a little rebrand so I guess they didn’t pick up that I worked for them under the old “similar but not quite the same” company name. In short, the talent acquisition company never told them I applied. 

Now I’m in talks with them but I’m pretty sure this is probably happening with other applications I apply to. I’m not sure what else I could’ve done without putting in big bold font “can legally work in the United States in the state that I live in” next to my name (some places just don’t have the checkbox in the application)?

Literally on a daily basis they’re changing it. So today at 4:30 I was notified that they changed my schedule to 6:30 pm to 6:30 am. Which is a 12 hour shift.

Last week I came in at 5:00 pm and they waited until 7:00 pm to tell us that we’re not getting off at 3:30 am but instead 7:00 am which was a 14 hour shift. But I was already there and I was already clocked in upon finding this out and could not come up with an excuse.

I’ll get off work at 3:30 am and wake up around 1:00 pm and my phone will randomly ring at 2-3 o clock saying “come in at 7:00 instead of 5 and work 12 hours instead of 10” and it happens quite literally daily.

Also, I’ll get be prepping to get off work Thursday at 3:00 am when I find out that we’re working THAT Friday. Which they hired me to only work Monday through Wednesday.

In the past 3 months I have worked my scheduled time one single day and the rest have been last minute changes in which they will fire or discipline you for not abiding.

jobs,"Hey Reddit community,

I hope this post finds you well. I'm reaching out today to share my recent experiences in the job market and to seek some advice and encouragement.

Graduating with a bachelor's degree in business and finance in January 2023, I was elated when I secured a role in a real estate technology firm. The prospect of leading marketing teams and onboarding clients seemed like a dream come true. However, my excitement was short-lived. While on a four-day vacation just before starting the new job, I received a Zoom meeting request from the company. The news was disheartening – they had to rescind the offer due to ""lack of funds and the unstable economy."" This unexpected turn ruined my vacation and sent me into a period of depression.

Since then, my job search has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. I've applied to 400 jobs through various portals, faced rejection after rejection, and had numerous interviews. The most recent setback involves a promising opportunity as a risk analyst. I had a successful interview with the CFO, who expressed interest in meeting again. However, communication has been lacking from the recruiter, leaving me in the dark about the next steps.

It's more than just a professional struggle; it's emotional. The constant rejections feel like a weight on my shoulders, making each application and interview a daunting experience. The silence and lack of follow-up after promising interviews are not just frustrating but downright disheartening. It feels embarrassing to update friends and family about my job search, especially when their expectations were high after my initial success.

The pressure from well-meaning family members adds an additional layer of stress. While they mean well, the constant inquiries about job prospects can be overwhelming. It's challenging to balance their concerns with the internal struggle of maintaining confidence and optimism in a seemingly endless job hunt.

I'm sharing my story here because I'm sure many of you have faced similar challenges in the job market. It's tough out there, and the emotional toll of constant rejections, uncertainty, and familial expectations is hard to bear. I'm reaching out for advice on how to navigate this difficult period and for any encouragement or success stories you might be willing to share.

Additionally, if anyone has tips on how to handle the emotional toll of the job search, the uncertainty of post-interview communications, or suggestions for improving my job search strategy, I would greatly appreciate it.

jobs,"
I was laid off two months ago and accepted the first job offer. I’ve received a new job offer for a hybrid/remote position with better benefits but slightly lower pay than my current new job. I’d like to take the new offer, as the current company is not great (high turnover, horrible and inconsistent scheduling, long term employees are miserable and keep warning me against the company)

The current job is planning on paying for certifications for me in January/February. This certifications are not essential for my long term goals, just essential for the current position. I’d like to quit before they spend more money on me, but the new job doesn’t start until mid January so I’d be going two weeks unemployed. The current job will have me leave on the spot to avoid further training which is understandable.

So I guess if I quit this week, I feel it’s the most considerate thing to do. But my family keeps saying to stay at the job until the new job starts. I have enough money for January bills but I’d probably be slumming it pretty severely for those two unemployed weeks.

Also I’m super nervous to quit it’s going to be very awkward. They’ve been wonderful and accommodating but the other job is just a better deal.

However, my company is having lay offs and I might lose my job in a few months.

The difference is that I would be doing my studies full time. Also, I have been applying for jobs for the last 4 months and have not recieved a single interview.

jobs,"TDLR; Online I see a lot of advice for standard job interviews and salary negotiations, but I’m not sure if they apply to my situation. I have already worked for this company but not as a full employee. How should I adjust my approach?

I hope you guys can give me some advice. This company has known me for years. I have finished an internship and several school projects under their guidance. After this I have done some freelance work for them while continuing my education. I have over 5 years of freelance experience (not limited to this company). They have been keeping me close and really seem to want to have me.

Last year they verbally offered me a job but I was still in school. Now I have graduated and so I emailed them to ask if the offer was still on the table. They have invited me for a chat in the new year and it all feels very informal.

Hi all, thank you in advance for any ideas but I've got a weird one.

So I've been interning at a company for a little while now to help pay for college and gain professional experience. Coincidentally, the company I work for got bought by a larger company that is rolling everyone into their new departments, interns included.

I've just graduated.

My current living space has had a leak for 2 months and they are new wanting to break the lease since they're having difficulty fixing the leak.

Here in lies the issue. My wife and I have applied for a new apartment and they expectedly are wanting proof of income (OR) an offer letter. The new company has assured that I'll be working in one of their new departments, I've had an interview a few months ago and last week they had me on a holiday team building call as if I were on the team now (they gave us all $30 towards ubereats so we could all eat together because it was a virtual meeting). They still have not sent the formal offer letter. I had already followed up once asking the new boss and approached my current boss (soon old boss) who said I'd get something last week.

Should I send a second follow up letter asking about an offer letter?

jobs,"Hello, Reddit community!  
  
I'm 26 years old, and I find myself at a crucial juncture reflecting on my professional life. I'd like to share my story and seek advice on two paths I'm considering for my future.  
  
Since a young age, I've been passionate about chess, technology, and economics. Currently, I work as a commercial consultant at a renowned company in Brazil called Stone. However, I don't feel fully happy or professionally fulfilled in sales. I hold a degree in Economics from a federal Brazilian university.  
  
I began my academic journey studying Electrical Engineering, but after a year, I switched to Economics, where I graduated last year. Despite this, my love for technology and computers persists, and I'm now contemplating a career change to the field of software development.  
  
Presently, I have a rating of approximately 2200 on chess.com, reflecting my enduring interest in chess. Additionally, I have a passion for learning and am considering acquiring skills in software development through online courses, such as those offered by Jonas and Maximilian Schwarzmüller.  
  
However, I'm faced with a dilemma. On one hand, I'm thinking about studying Computer Science at the same university where I graduated in Economics. This would open the possibility of becoming a developer but would take about five years until graduation. There's also concern that the degree may not be globally valued, given the institution's reputation.  
  
On the other hand, I have the option to study for three years to compete for a public sector position as an economist in my country. While this is a safer choice, the maximum salary would be around 50 thousand dollars per year. Still, this option would require a period without income.  
  
Beyond these challenges, I'm dealing with fibromyalgia, leading me to prefer remote work. I'm going through a period of depression and questioning the direction of my career.  
  
Currently, my salary as a commercial consultant is 8 thousand dollars per year, a figure I consider low compared to global standards. Looking at job opportunities on LinkedIn, I realize that positions in the technology field offer much more attractive salaries.  
  
I'm at a crossroads and seeking advice. Should I pursue my dream of transitioning to technology, becoming a developer, and seeking opportunities abroad? Or should I adopt a more pragmatic approach, investing time in studying for a public sector job in my country?  
  
I appreciate everyone who can share their experiences and advice. What path would you choose if you were in my shoes? How can I effectively navigate this transition? I'm open to any guidance that can help me make this crucial decision for my future and that of my mother, who has supported me on this journey.  
  
I'm curious to hear from those who have pursued alternative paths into software development. Whether it's attending university while simultaneously learning Frontend and Backend, enrolling in a renowned bootcamp, or even venturing into self-taught development, your insights would be immensely valuable. Feel free to suggest other potential avenues that I might not have considered. I have a vision of reaching a salary of 50 thousand dollars within the next two years.

jobs,"So I applied to this job on indeed as a “text reviser” and they’ve sent me this email back. Please keep in mind that they have never met me and I have no relevant experience. I’m 90% sure this is a scam but just want to make sure. The email is below:

“My name is Luke Mitchell, and I am a representative of the company POWER.
Please see the details below: 

My company offers you a part-time long-term job with a free schedule and the possibility of career growth.
You don't need any special education, specific skills or work experience.
This work is available to every responsible person who speaks English fluently and has access to the Internet during the day time.
At the initial stage of cooperation, the work will take 30 - 60 minutes a day.
At the same time, your guaranteed income will be $ 40 - $ 150 per day.
You will be able to choose the amount of daily work and earn several times more in future .
For example, some of our employees having at least six months of work experience earn 300-400 dollars per day.
We will describe the entire workflow to you in detail.

1. About our Company.
We are an international trading company.
https://www.power.no/
We have been working in the US market for more than 5 years and the US market is gradually becoming the main. That is why we are expanding our staff in the USA.
Unlike other companies, we do business completely online.
We do not need to rent expensive real estate, gather staff in the morning, spend time on the way from home to work and back, and so on.
All this saves our money, which we prefer to pay for the work to our employees.

2. About the vacancy.
We invite you to start working with us to take a vacancy as ""online office manager"".
You will spend 30-60 minutes a day working with our documents. 
What the documents are: 
We will be sending you sets of texts of our internal and external correspondence.
This is an online communication between our employees and customers who are located in different parts of the world.
Despite the language barrier all correspondence is in English.
Perhaps you know that the English language of an Indian person is very different from the English of a Chinese person as well as an European person.
This is the reason we need employees from the USA to correct errors or grammar mistakes in the documents. 
Poor English communication leads to financial losses very often.
To avoid this, we need an employee who will receive the texts of correspondence, check them for grammatical, semantic or stylistic errors that can lead to misunderstanding.
All messages of our employees are collected in a special chat before being redirected to the recipient.
We will send you several texts from the correspondence once a day.
You need to read these texts, understand and correct or highlight the places where the text loses its meaning, or if there are any inaccuracies.
For an American who speaks English, this will not be difficult, since we do not discuss complex technical processes.
Our work is related only to online trading.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;About our Company.
We are an international trading company.
&lt;a href=""https://www.power.no/""&gt;https://www.power.no/&lt;/a&gt;
We have been working in the US market for more than 5 years and the US market is gradually becoming the main. That is why we are expanding our staff in the USA.
Unlike other companies, we do business completely online.
We do not need to rent expensive real estate, gather staff in the morning, spend time on the way from home to work and back, and so on.
All this saves our money, which we prefer to pay for the work to our employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the vacancy.
We invite you to start working with us to take a vacancy as &amp;quot;online office manager&amp;quot;.
You will spend 30-60 minutes a day working with our documents. 
What the documents are: 
We will be sending you sets of texts of our internal and external correspondence.
This is an online communication between our employees and customers who are located in different parts of the world.
Despite the language barrier all correspondence is in English.
Perhaps you know that the English language of an Indian person is very different from the English of a Chinese person as well as an European person.
This is the reason we need employees from the USA to correct errors or grammar mistakes in the documents.

jobs," 

Non Profitable companies are citing AI as a reason to layoff. Reality is C-levels are hiding behind AI to hide their failures and incompetency. Everyone jumped on blockchain bandwagon, now we got AI but in reality I have not seen one proper research commenting on AI taking jobs, let alone any researcher or scientist commenting at least. Most popular research is actually just commenting on the lack of data to predicted trends in labour market. YouTube influencers and media, which to be honest, if you are blindly following, just leave the industry man, are just fear mongering for views.

I don't know what's about to happen in next 5 or 10 years and if you find anyone who does, hold them by the throat and ask them to bloody fucking prove it.

There are 3 types of perspectives I have seen on whether AI or robots will take our jobs or not

1. Doomsday Perspective - Some studies have found that AI and robots are going to reduce the employment opportunities as much by 60% in developed and developing countries mainly due to automation. This has already happened in the manufacturing industry specially in automobile industry.
2. Optimistic Perspective - Others are citing that technological advances create more job opportunities rather than decreasing in sectors which are not in direct competition of the technology. Think of times before excel, bookkeepers which were in direct competition of it, lost or were forced to adapt but with hindsight, we can tell it was overall better for the accounting industry. Other example is internet, email and loose of employment in telegram and letter industry.
3. Unified Perspective - Now as per this, you job, is a set of skills. Some of your skills will replaced by new technology but it's not going to affect your job.

Keeping in mind that most of the research is done in US and EU, thereby biased to their economic climate conditions, we can extrapolate the conclusion to foresee Indian conditions based on our experiences.

jobs,"Hello again. Some not great things happened this retail holiday weekend. The HR lady informed me that this week I would need to ""talk about things"" with her and the store director (so I ""wouldn’t be blindsided""). I'm unsure if a firing, suspension, or ""just"" a writeup is waiting behind that meeting, but that leads me to a question: if I'm written up, what impact does that actually have?

Obviously it's not ""nothing"" (unless I'm actually wrong haha). But I'm having trouble thinking of what it would actually mean for me. If I'm still there and working and being paid, what's the deal?

jobs,"My company had a large layoff/reorg a little over a year ago, and a different (extremely toxic) director and PM took over my team. Since then, they have fired 4 and ran off 2 people from my 8 person team - highly valuable resources that had no basis for being fired other than having an opinion that was expressed respectfully. Complaints to HR fell on deaf ears, or resulted in being fired. It's clear that it's just a matter of time for myself and the other remaining coworker. This director oversees two teams covering two products that are essentially a conflict of interest. And he projects his feelings toward our product onto the team supporting it. 

I've been with my company for 18 years and have worked under a couple other directors in the past that were decent to work for. Would it be stupid of me to reach out to them to ask if they could pull me onto one of their teams? I have been told by a person outside of my team that several managers have been making positive comments about me to leadership. I've been attending meetings meant for PMs because mine couldn't be bothered to do it. 

When we all complained to HR a year ago, we basically were told to just look for openings in the internal job postings, but there haven't been any for any of the jobs I cover (essentially 3 different roles) , or they have been budgeted for a level I whereas I'm a level III. 

And to put icing on the cake, I just saw my performance review, and my PM gave me a ""meets expectations"". I've received ""exceeds expectations"" on every review for the last several years. As far back as I can remember. And because of so many getting fired, I proactively took on the work of two other people, rarely expressed dissent, and have even done a lot of my PM's job! Because ""I know it like the back of my hand"" as I was told. I'm considered a SME (subject matter expert) for the product, and the PM has made very little effort to learn it in the past year.

I'm almost 40 and planned to retire at this company, but now I just want to keep my job safe while I look for other opportunities. The company's HR team has made it crystal clear that they're not there for any of the employees below C level execs.

jobs,"Hi, I don’t know if I am wrong to feel this way about the situation or not. I am a 18F and I work as a barista for a coffee shop. It’s a very nice job and I really like it! But this Christmas Eve my manager told me that I had to work alone because they transferred the coworker I was suppose to work with to another store. I was very upset but I decided to accept anyway because I didn’t want to make a huge issue. I was very surprised my manager said I would have to work alone considering there is a bar next door to our shop and I have to manage the drive thru and the front by myself. I decided to just take the task anyway because I didn’t know at the time that I’m not suppose to be working alone because it’s illegal in some places or against the companies rules. I tell my mom and she storms into my job telling me to leave because of an emergency. She was more upset than me about leaving me alone to close the store by myself as a female. I also don’t look strong or anything to fend someone off, god forbid something happens. Also my manager said that it wasn’t busy today before he left from the morning shift but when I was working I was driving myself crazy. It was so busy and I had to manage the drive thru and the front. Reminder it was only an hour that passed and this many people came in. So my mom was really telling me to message him to leave for an emergency after seeing how busy it was by myself. (Also this guy kept walking past the store and kept walking in not ordering anything and he came from the bar. It was really weird, and this is what I was talking about with my fear of working by myself as a female). So I tell my manager that I have to leave. He says okay and just close the store and put notes everywhere saying the store is closed. I did most of the closing task, the only thing I didn’t do from the list was closing the cash registers, cleaning the bathroom, sweeping and mopping the floor, and turning the sanitizer off (honestly forgot about the sanitizer). But remind you the closing list IS SUPER LONG. I did 95% of the task for closing the best I could by myself. My mom was also kinda rushing me because again it was an emergency. I washed the dishes, closed the entire food area, cleaned most of the counters, cleaned the machines (except for the other coffee machine that I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW TO CLEAN!). Also I wrote on a sticky note that I didn’t close the cash registers before I left so the morning shift wouldn’t open it and use it without knowing I didn’t close it. I literally said sorry and everything on the note because I knew I was inconveniencing the morning shift. (Also another reminder the morning shift does nothing to open. The closing shift has so many task and a long list of what to do, but the morning shift does nothing to open. So I didn’t really find it an issue if they had to close the cash register because they aren’t really doing anything anyway. When I work the morning they are mostly standing around waiting for customers). So this morning I wake up today and my manager sends a message to the entire location group chat, saying that we have to get the closing list done every night regardless of circumstances. Idk maybe I’m over reacting but I just found it really rude to say especially to the entire group chat for my location who all knows I was working by myself that day. Also I literally did most of the task. I only missed 5 things that honestly I believe my manager should have done after I left the store. I thought it’s a managers job to make sure everything is clean or done correctly especially if I have to close the store early that day because of an emergency. I am also new, I started working a few months ago. I don’t even know how to really close everything by myself. That’s why I don’t understand why he’s just blaming this stuff on me when he already knows I’m not even skilled or ready enough to close by myself. Idk, again I might be over reacting. But I really tried that day and I just feel as if he just said whatever to me doing most of the task by myself. Also I find it quite not okay that you have to close the store and do all the closing list no matter the emergency. My other coworker has been constantly going to the hospital, so if they had an emergency at work because of a health problem or a genuine family issue, you can’t leave until you complete this long list for closing, by yourself?!? I just kinda find that really wrong, and again as a manager I would think he would have tried to help me or come by during Christmas when the store was closed the day after I worked to check if everything was okay for when the store opens for the morning shift the next day. Idk I just really want advice on this. I hope I made it understandable. I’m okay with being told I’m wrong and that I’m over reacting because this is technically my first job. And I don’t really understand how all of this really works. But when I told my family they was really upset because I was already working by myself as a female closing the store, there’s a bar literally right next to the store, and I walk home alone in the dark after closing because my house is kinda near. (I also didn’t want to get robbed because again I’m alone, also the back door to the store is completely unlocked while I’m working, so literally anyone can just walk in through the back without me noticing). I hope to get some advice on this. I’m not trying to blow this situation out of proportion by reporting or doing really drastic things about this because I’m not that type of person to cause unnecessary conflict :/

jobs,"M22, I've been a cooking in a kitchen for the last 5 years and simply put, this just isn't something I want to do forever. The long hours, working on weekends and holidays, and beating myself up for little pay and no benefits is just not worth it. This was my first ever job in high school and I've got way too comfortable here and putting up with the nonsense that I've never fully left. I was in college for 1 year doing computer science, school in general just isn't for me. I also tried construction and trades and that was also something not for me. 

I've been looking at various career changes far and wide such as being a mail carrier or 911 dispatcher but one that stood out to me was a job at one of the distributors at my restaurant that delivers our uniforms, towels, and linens. They're hiring service representatives with a $2000 sign on bonus. I'm familiar with the whole work process just from interacting with the rep that comes to our place and I understand what the job entails.

Essentially I'd be driving around to restaurants and business and dropping off clean uniforms/linens and taking dirty ones, as well as being a point of contact between the company and the customer. The base salary is $10-20k higher than my job now, plus I have commission for any additional product I upsell but no quota. This job is Monday through Friday, daytime hours with nights, holidays and weekends off which sounds pretty neat. And full benefits with company matched 401k.

The job still seems a little physical with having to walk and drop off linens and take bags of dirty linens but arguably less physical than a kitchen job. Also this job seems to have a lot of upward mobility and growth potential into management positions that are more office based.

jobs,"I’ve been out of work for about two months and I’m currently a full-time student in college. I’m looking for a part-time job over the winter break because I have overdue expenses that need to be paid by mid-January. Therefore I’m expecting atleast two weeks of pay and to be hired.

I had an interview for a dishwashing job about two weeks ago and it went extremely well. The interview concluded with them telling me, no, assuring me, that they’d call me back either later that day or the day after, to which I replied, sounds great. 

No call on both days, and I ended up waiting roughly a week before calling again. The store manager told me the hiring manager wasn’t in, and that they would write my name down and give it to the hiring manager. She said that in the meantime, she would review my notes and that the hiring manager should get back to me in a day or so. I said okay, thank you. I got no contact from the hiring manager within the provided timeframe, so I called again and spoke to the hiring manager directly. She told me that she’ll look over the notes and contact me again. I say okay.

Mind you, this is not a big store. This is an extremely small store on the block.

I get tired of calling, so I told my mom to call the store as an anonymous person to ask for an update on the hiring process. The store told her that they were still looking over candidates. I called a couple days after that, few days before Christmas, and asked the hiring manager for an update on my application. And she sounded apologetic, telling me that she will 100% call me tomorrow. It never came.

Christmas is over, so I’m debating calling the store again this morning to ask about my application. I hate to be annoying but this job is important to me so I’m able to pay certain expenses. There’s also no where else on campus hiring, and I don’t have a car so I can’t work anywhere that’s not within walking distance. I applied to about 40+ jobs and none of them got back to me.

Is's getting a bit unhealthy. I'm 33 and kind of young in this field. Thus I want to compensate for not being around 10-15yrs extra like most others in the field.

Don't get me wrong I love the IT field, problem solving, coding, have expertise in certain areas, etc. and I'm very eager at the same time.

Hence I always have some coding project, watch some new videos, try to advance my skills. Behavior that is weird because:

a. As long as I embrace change and new tech by default, I should be set b. Nobody knows what the future might bring anyways

jobs,"Hi everyone. I hope you’ve had a lovely holiday &amp; are doing well. I’m seeking some advice, and I’d love some perspectives aside from my own and some of the people closest to me. 

I’ve been at my current job for 1.5 years. I am a mental health technician, so I do group therapy with people who have different mental health diagnosis. My job is very stressful. I have been cussed out, kicked, etc. I have broken up fights between two patients. 

 I’ve been a great employee since day one. I’ve been employee of the month before my 90 days evaluation, gotten a great review (no raise, but no one got one), my supervisor adores me, and so do the patients I work with. I’ve taken on some extra work to show my competency (mostly organizing patient info, making our systems more efficient.) 

I was told in August 2023 that a role was being created for me, as an assistant to my supervisor. This is a position that was previously open years ago, but closed due to covid. Every few months, I was promised more info on it. “After this budget meeting we will know.”  And then “after this other budget meeting we will know.” Our company is a multimillion dollar healthcare company. 

So a few weeks ago, I requested a meeting with my boss and their boss (c-suite member). Where I was told “I just want you to know we haven’t forgotten about you. We should know something January/February. We do need to fill your position, before we can move you fully into that role. Your other coworker is also going on temporary leave, and should be back june ‘24.”  

So my immediate supervisor then tells me I’ll be doing my current role, plus the assistant role at least until my coworker comes back in June. I’m very disappointed by this. I’ve already been waiting 6 months for this promotion. They haven’t even posted a job opening for anyone to temp for my coworker or take over my job. 

I start graduate school next month, and I do plan to work while I attend school. Everyone keeps telling me to get a part time job, because grad school is intense. I am trying really hard not to have the “grass is greener mentality”, but I feel taken for granted at my current job. I do have decent benefits, decent pay and my supervisor is great. But I feel like I’m not going anywhere. I wouldn’t be so frustrated if the promotion was never mentioned to me, but it was. In fact, my boss’ boss HANDED me the job description. 

I find myself losing morale. I think I’m frustrated more with the fact that I’m expected to double up on work, with no clue what my pay will be. When I asked upper mgmt, they said “of course you’ll get a raise. We just don’t know how much.”

I had an interview with a placement agency last week for a brand ambassador position and the Independent Contactor Agreement states the following:

Can someone explain what they are gathering from this fee mentioned? To me it sounds like I have to pay a fee to the agency for placing me in the position i'm working. It also sounds like a 4 year contact?

I have to list myself as an independent contractor and i'd be making $ 35-40 an hour for events but am not paid for training and payment for long-distance drive time is a case-by-case basis. The number of events you receive (aka hours worked) depends on how well you do.  Not sure if this is worth it due to things like end of the year taxes and finding health insurance.

jobs,"So currently I’m 24 years old. Graduated from NYU with a degree in political science decided to pursue sales instead of law. After a couple of unsuccessful jobs in data I moved to State Farm’s sales. 

PROS: Now here at State Farm, the job is a piece of cake and is even fully remote. I send about 20-90 follow ups to people who need auto or life insurance(licensed in both) from leads we get. The follow ups are literally just me copying and pasting their quotes that’s been simplified to create easily for us and putting it into a template that I send to their phones or email. I usually call them as well first follow up. I work for three different agencies doing this and make about 5,272 per month or 63k per year. I also get commission on top of that…

CONS: now with commission sometimes these agents I  work for are dishonest and are a little rude and don’t even pay me out commission sometimes but always follow the base pay I mentioned above. Another con is no room for growth. There is agency ownership but it requires 150k in assets I own which I do not. 

Or should I take a job in medical sales or home improvement sales? Both would be in person, both have a bit of a higher pay around 70k + commission but would seem more stressful and less flexible.

jobs,"Hey everyone,

I’m going to put my heart out because strangers often give the best advice ever.

I’ve been working at my current company (fortune 10) since I was an intern. Fast forward I’ve gotten a masters degree and celebrated my 5th year anniversary and I’m still here. I also work remotely and I’ve been able to move and it’s pretty felixible with work/life balance. I don’t like my current boss and I’m also sick and tired of the common layoffs that happen every 3 months that cripple me in bed. A few months ago a company reached out and interviewed me they were great they’re in consulting and they have massive billion dollar clients, they offer an insanely higher salary growth and challenges that will offer me learning and new skills since I’ve been at my current company I’ve been complacent I kinda stay for the paycheck and the good work culture but I’m tired of my boss she’s a lunatic and controlling I’m in my 20s and take care of my family financially 

So during my Christmas PTO which I saved up 2 1/2 weeks the new company reached out and offered me the job they told me if I could start Monday (I’m off on PTO with my first job) I thought sure I’m off and I’d like to try out this job bec I have this weird attachment to my first job regardless of how many of my friends they laid off 

I’ve never had stability in my life so here’s my chance to try something new and break my fake sense of stability in corporate America 

And so I started this new job while on PTO with my first job (I know I feel endless anxiety and guilt) 

This new job although prestigious with cool clients has worked me 10 hours a day and the manager keeps telling me it’s bec we’re in a new project but won’t always be this way now I’m exhilarated and excited to start something new but afraid to let go and give my two week notice to my first job and as a matter of fact I don’t know how to give them a two week notice anymore bec im kinda working for the second job as I thought heh I’ll just trial it and see how it goes while on break.

Please don’t judge me I’m anxious I support 7 people I can’t just up and go sometimes and my background check took forever to clear so I couldn’t just quit I don’t know what to do I guess I’m looking for someone to tell me what I should do because I’m scared of change and failure and this job is high paced high demand but god the paycheck felt good especially giving my mom $500 extra this month on her birthday and Christmas. It made me feel good buying what I want at the grocery store and buying new shoes I haven’t done that in years bec im taking care of everyone

jobs,"M22, I've been a cook for the last 5 years and I want a career change. I'm tired of working on my feet 12+ hours a day for barely any money and want to get into something I can afford a future with and make a career out of. I already tried college but school isn't for me, nor is construction/trades. Based off of my restaurant background and working every weekend/holiday, I'm a lot more open to various things most people would hate but also don't mind a change. I've been job searching and narrowed it down to 2 options, 911 dispatcher or a Route Service Representative at UniFirst responsible for delivering linens to businesses.

RSR at UniFirst:

Pros

\- Monday through Friday, daytime hours

\- Weekends and Holidays off

\- 401k, health insurance, PTO, life insurance, etc

\- $45-55k base salary + commission for any product I'd sell

Cons

\- Outside in the elements driving/getting out of truck to deliver

\- Physical labor having to transport heavy linens

\- Unsure on growth opportunities or if possible to make a career out of this job

&amp;#x200B;

911 Dispatch:

Pros:

\- Really good pay, starting pay in my area is $60k and it tops out somewhere around $80k not including overtime and continuous raises

\- Indoor job at a desk that's not as physically intensive

\- Optional overtime

\- 8 hour shifts with the ability to eventually bid and permanently switch to day shifts 8am-4pm. 5 days on 2 days off

\- Full benefits including pension

\- Job security

Cons:

\- Starting out I may have unpredictable hours. I could start off working either days, afternoons, or overnights and wouldn't know until I apply.

\- I may have to work weekends/holidays until I get an established schedule

\- Having to deal with the public and potential stress that may come from it

jobs,"I need help/advice!

**Background/Experience:** I've been unemployed for +9 months. I received two job offers. I'm a government worker. I worked for the state government in my state for +2.5 years/experience.

**First job offer:** One job offer is with the state government. My start date for that job is tomorrow. It's in a department that I wanted to work in (one that helps people with disabilities).

**Second job offer (conditional):** The second job offer is with the city government. It's a conditional offer. I've wanted to work for the city government because it pays more than state government. This specific position pays around $20,000 more than the state government one.

**My thinking:** My thinking was to work the state government job (which starts tomorrow) if and until I receive an official job offer from the city government job. There are a few problems with that:

1) I'd only be working for a few weeks/month, so I wouldn't be working there long.

2) If I work at a state government department, even for a few weeks/month, it's going to be on my government worker record, and I don't want it on my record that I worked at a place for a few weeks or a month and quit. It looks bad. I've done this before and was asked about it. I don't want to create a pattern of this behavior.

3) I was told in an email by a city government representative that if I require a background check (which most people do require), then I'd have to go and get fingerprinted. That would mean if I worked at the state government job first then I'd have to come up with an excuse to take a partial day off to get fingerprinted.

**My other thinking:** Don't take the state government job. Wait for a few weeks until city government contacts me to get fingerprinted and wait for an official city government job offer.

Anybody have advice regarding my current situation/circumstance?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background/Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve been unemployed for +9 months. I received two job offers. I&amp;#39;m a government worker. I worked for the state government in my state for +2.5 years/experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First job offer:&lt;/strong&gt; One job offer is with the state government. My start date for that job is tomorrow. It&amp;#39;s in a department that I wanted to work in (one that helps people with disabilities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second job offer (conditional):&lt;/strong&gt; The second job offer is with the city government. It&amp;#39;s a conditional offer. I&amp;#39;ve wanted to work for the city government because it pays more than state government. This specific position pays around $20,000 more than the state government one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thinking:&lt;/strong&gt; My thinking was to work the state government job (which starts tomorrow) if and until I receive an official job offer from the city government job. There are a few problems with that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I&amp;#39;d only be working for a few weeks/month, so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be working there long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) If I work at a state government department, even for a few weeks/month, it&amp;#39;s going to be on my government worker record, and I don&amp;#39;t want it on my record that I worked at a place for a few weeks or a month and quit. It looks bad. I&amp;#39;ve done this before and was asked about it. I don&amp;#39;t want to create a pattern of this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) I was told in an email by a city government representative that if I require a background check (which most people do require), then I&amp;#39;d have to go and get fingerprinted. That would mean if I worked at the state government job first then I&amp;#39;d have to come up with an excuse to take a partial day off to get fingerprinted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My other thinking:&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;#39;t take the state government job. Wait for a few weeks until city government contacts me to get fingerprinted and wait for an official city government job offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody have advice regarding my current situation/circumstance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"Hi guys, I’m currently a KYC analyst at a Dutch Bank. I work through an intermediary in Amsterdam. I’ve worked for 2 years and have an undergraduate and masters degree from Nottingham and Amsterdam. 

I got a job straight after I graduated from my masters degree. I studied my thesis on mafia related issues, so when offered a job in AML / KYC, I saw it as a semi relevant job. There is also in the Netherlands the prospect of working freelance, where the salaries are significantly higher. 

I feel like my progression is now stagnating. I don’t enjoy the job as much as I previously did, as I understand much of it is very monotonous, very little office time (which as a 23 year old is not something I feel is beneficial as the social side suffers) and nothing feels client facing. One of my best skills is communication, networking and speaking and I feel like I’m neglecting these traits in this role. Furthermore, I feel that I would suit a role more commission based in the future, as I often feel incentivised to do the bare minimum (the carrot and the stick method of extra money I feel would benefit me). 

With trends moving away from freelancing, it seems largely money for the role (which other people in my team earn) seems to be off the table for now. 

I’m not sure what moves to make, where to move within this field to be able to have a more client facing role, or one with more progression, or to move to a relevant field which does have commission related jobs which are also more client facing and interactive.

jobs,"Hi,

Im a first year pe teacher who is looking to quit their job. It’s honestly miserable and very draining. I always thought I wanted to do this but now I’m having my regrets. I enjoy teaching but I hate the babysitting and walking on eggshells. During college I never understood teachers that hated their job and always complained but now it makes clear sense to me. I want to get out but have no clue what to do once I’m out. 

I definitely don’t want to go back to get another degree. Although I loved my college days, going back and taking another 2 or 3 years is too much. I don’t want to be mid to late 20s and finally getting a real career started. 

Any recommendations? 

Here’s what I’ve been looking at so far:

Some people are recommending for me to do an it course. I have no clue what type of jobs you will get with it. Am I just tech support? I am good with computers.

I could also go into manual labor if I get an apprenticeship, I won’t go back to trade school and then get an apprenticeship tho. So if I get it as I am.

Lastly I would get my cdl and start trucking. My mom hates this and tells me she would accept any other job besides this. Idk why. 

A little bit about me:
I have a degree in PE.
I have a PPL. I will continue my lessons in this not matter what and get more ratings. But it’s something you do on the weekends. Plus you need a lot of money. It’s an uncertain path as well. So that’s why it’s not the first option. 
I suck at math. Like really bad. I’ve tried and tried but I’m telling you I don’t get it.

jobs,"I’ll do my best to keep this short but earlier this week, my coworker accosted me in our office in front of other coworkers. This past week we were severely understaffed because our supervisor approved way too many people’s time off request for the holiday — and unfortunately, a coworker of ours resigned, so what may have appeared to be enough coverage for those off, ended up not being enough coverage once that other team member resigned. 

Anyway fast forward to the incident that inspired this post, my coworker was upset that I had assigned her too much work. Now it should be noted our boss was also off for the holiday, so I more or less had to wear 3 different hats, and do the job of 3 people. Im being intentionally vague about my position, but will do my best to describe the roles enough for context. 
My boss, normally acts as an editor, I find content and write, and the coworker who accosted me, is just assigned to write. 

Because my supervisor was off, and we were basically down to a skeleton crew, I had to write more than usual, splitting that work with my coworker. I also had to play editor (my boss’s role) while also still doing my main role—which is finding content etc.

So according to my coworker, she was upset because she felt I gave her too much work to do on a day where she is the only writer. I tried to explain to her, we’re all stretched thin today and all will have to do more. Instead she turned around and told me I was incompetent, she was tired of “bussing her a**” for me, and being stressed out because I don’t know what I’m doing. She says this of course in front of all of our colleagues. Now for me I felt this was pretty unfair, because me and this coworker 90% of the time work independently of each other, but her complaints would make it seem as if this had been an ongoing issue. The other thing to know is that while she accused me of giving her too much work and didn’t have enough time to do it. She was arguing with me through our work chat messaging app. For about 2 hours she sent me nasty message after nasty message, this then spilled over to her confronting me in the office when I got out of a meeting. So here’s my thing, if you say you had no time do said assignments, how did you have time incessantly message me for 2 hours?

Anyway, I’m trying to reason with her. I say something to the point of “x I’m sorry I made you feel x y and z…” her response is “oh no, it’s not a feeling it’s fact.” She then goes on to say all I do is complain, all I do is over talk people, I’m the queen of over talking people…and the entire time mind you, her voice is raising, I’m listening, but each time I try to speak, she begins yelling overtop of me. She then goes to accuse me of intentionally trying to make her life hell, and I’m like “X, I’m not trying to intentionally target you.” We are understaffed today, I’ve tried to split the work assignments between us equally, but I also have two other jobs to do, to your one job. I also have to prioritize how to divide these jobs up because I can’t do all 3. She is yelling, over talking me, I eventually just tell her to report this to our direct boss when they come back, because the conversation wasn’t productive. It as literally her shouting at me, and humiliating me in front of our peers. Now before all this happened, it’s important to know, me and this girl use to be “friends”—like occasionally hang out after work and talk on the phone. But I noticed towards the end of the summer she began acting cold towards me. But because we never had a fight or disagreement, I kinda just respected her space, after all we’re colleagues before anything else. So when this all happened, it let me know that some of this is stemming from something much more personal. I’m just not sure what. 

To make it even worse, I then heard from another coworker, that this woman went around the office asking everyone if she should include me in the gifts she intended to give everyone. The consensus was from everyone that if she was going to exclude me, then don’t bring in gifts for anyone. But the thing that really offended me more is that she dragged the early episode out by going around the office and basically taking a poll on whether she should give me a Christmas gift. To me that was so unnecessary. 

I guess I’m unsure how to navigate this when I go back to work this week. I don’t think I complain too much, and I think it’s rich she said those things about me, cuz everything she accused me of, she was doing. She refused do certain work assignments I gave her, she put wrong assignments in that completely went against the instructions left for her. So it made my job even more difficult and caused me to get behind on some key deadlines, which caused me to get some bad reviews from another department.

I guess my fear is, I’m not sure how to approach my boss about this, because I don’t want to come across like I’m not taking responsibility. But at the same time I feel like my coworker is incredibly lazy, she thinks on days when we are understaffed it means she gets an “easier” day because she expects everyone to take it easy on her. I also just feel like in general, regardless of how she feels, you have to remain a sense of professionalism. It’s really not fair any of us were left so understaffed but expected to still deliver the same workload. But I can’t toss my hands up and refuse to do my work.

I have been working for a company for almost 5 years. During this time, I’ve been providing support to different places around the Chicagoland area. Me and my team faced the worst time to work during COVID, but we were there. I recently received my review and most of my colleagues receive a higher raise than me. Is it fair? Well, that is fine. I have another job, I did not consider this like a big issue, but it was not fair. I’ve seen people with less time than me with higher positions and better pay. The incredible part, my bosses offered me another position, which I cannot take because I have another job (they know), and if I accepted, it will reduce my salary. So, I decided to wait for my next assignment. But wait, I saw in the company web page another opening, but my boss said it was all set with it. Well, when a position is already taken, they remove it. Did they lie? 

A couple day before Christmas, one of my partners sent me a text message, did you quit? What are you taking about? I replied. Yes, I sent you an email and it says you are not longer working with us anymore. I went to my gmail account and it says my password was changed an hour ago. 

It seems like that they do not care. Just because I am not a kissing ass person. I always went to do my job, but never make compliments to them. I am not that kind of employee. 

The last three years, the company where “I was” working with has become in a place where only friends and family members can get a better position or a good raise. 

They do not respect the people with longer time with them, just because they do not say compliments about their make up, hair or clothing. 

This has not been a good Christmas at all. I will probably get a phone call on Tuesday to finally let me go. 

If you feel unappreciated, or company does not value what you do for them, think about quitting. I decided to stay just because the time I was working them, almost five years of my life.

Long story short, I'm looking to switch careers, and the main thing I'm looking for is a health-adjacent job that doesn't require a health-related college degree. I've looked at data analytics, medical coding, clinic receptionist, and a few other options. 

One thing I've noticed is that, for most full-time jobs, it's a given that benefits will include health, vision, and dental insurance. The one exception to this is receptionist jobs in clinics. Almost half of the clinic receptionist jobs clearly state in the job description that health insurance is not offered, despite the fact that these listings are for full-time jobs. This phenomenon is specific to receptionist and administrative assistant job listings, as far as I've noticed.

jobs,"My design agency is a bit niche and based in the suburbs of Pennsylvania. We design branding and invitation + day of items for high end clients. 

I joined the team as a mid-level designer with 2 years under my belt and have been here for a year and a half. I was started off with 45K. I didn’t negotiate this and accepted it because I was so excited to work under this specific agency. 

My first annual review was only 3 months into my employment and it was with my project manager and two art directors over zoom. Super casual and just discussed the projects I did and what they liked. No critical advice besides being open to ask questions to my coworkers.

I always hone in on the absolute worst case scenario. Ian very aware that I’m likely doing that now but would appreciate anyone’s opinion. 

Long story short, my husband had an interview and was offered the job. We got the email for him to sign off for a background check the day after the interview, which was Friday at 5:24pm. Filled it all out, sent it back. Did the drug screen today, Christmas Eve.

Both of those times his employers commented on how fast the results came back. I know there’s nothing criminal or anything like ghat to be worried about but he may have been less than truthful about how long he was at his last couple jobs. Although I’m not even sure if the background company would check that. I mean, on the background check it didn’t ask for anything at all except basically his bday and SS#. And it gave him instructions on where to go take a drug test. Didn’t ask at all about any criminal charges, whether he had a diploma or GED, past employment. None of that. So I’m assuming this is just a basic criminal history check. What do you think? I know I’m likely worrying for nothing but can someone tell me what they think please?

jobs,"Hi guys, I need some job/finances advice. I’m based in the UK for context. 
TL:DR - do I stay at my employer or take a job with a huge pay rise?

I’m currently working on a 26k salary on an FTC. I applied to move elsewhere and got a job for 41k. Told my employer and they countered with 33k and a perm contract 6 months earlier than initially planned.

I accepted the 33k because I do like my company and I feel like I have a lot more to learn before I go elsewhere and my team gives me that support and I don’t think that 41k company was for me so rejecting that felt like the right decision.

In the background, there was one job that I had applied to but it was kind of in the background and I didn’t think I would get it anyways and as it’s a huge company the interview process is quite long. 
After telling my employer that I would stay, the other big company contacted me to say they are offering me the position but it’s just going through approvals etc but that I’m definitely being offered it.

This job is for 45-50k, for a really huge company , a household name for my industry and to work there would open so many doors. It’s a company you don’t say no to given the opportunity, they say no to you…

I also don’t feel that I have the knowledge required for that role and am worried it won’t go well, but I am ready to learn and do what it takes.

I already told my employer that I would stay, and they are drafting my new contract for me to sign in the next few days, if I was to turn back on my word it would look terrible and I do like my team and my current company. 

My worry is, if I decline this other offer will I get this opportunity again? I feel like I would regret it because this might be a once in lifetime opportunity that could change my life.

But my employer is great too so it’s hard.

jobs,"TDLR: I’m an experienced caregiver with my massage therapy license trying to find out how to find quality high paying private pay gigs

Hello, I’m new to exclusively private pay care situations and am trying to figure out how to best navigate finding said situations. Some background: I was a certified Caregiver for 9 years and have been a Licensed Massage Therapist for 5 (there was a 3 year overlap of the two). I worked for DSHS in my home state and was paid pretty well compared to the rest of the USA (go unions!) and had some random private pay situations. I’ve been in Texas for a few years, and had a massage therapy business where I did well but I was basically exhausting myself 24/7 to make it work so I stepped back. My city is not great to be an LMT, and of course any caregiving job’s pay is beyond deplorable. I have a Care dot com account I thought about paying for again, as once before I was looking for a a situation that would pay private, well, and appreciate legitimate massage therapy as part of my services but ended up moving.

jobs,"I’ve been working at a store for 7 months, not much less time than the other employees also working there. I expected to not get a lot of shifts as it was told to me during the job interview but it was also said that hours would increase during Christmas time.  

I stuck it out for months, hopeful for a chance to work more during Christmas only to get slapped in the face. I took a peek at the rosters in the back room only to see my boss had given me one measly 4 hr shift the week of Christmas whilst giving others 3-5 shifts.

I have been a reliable worker and tried my hardest to meet the store’s ridiculous KPIs for months. But because I don’t become besties with my manager, I get punished for it. 

I did ask her why she did this, and she didn’t say why but just that she would shuffle the roster around to give me more shifts. I didn’t even receive an apology. She gave me 2 more shifts, but I had come to realise later instead of taking off a shift from those that had 5 shifts that week to give to me, she took it off the coworker with only 3 shifts that week.

TLDR AT THE BOTTOM. The in between is just me venting about my last job.

My last job was a Commission Coordinator in large utility scale solar panel projects. We owned a black box that controlled a motor to dictate the angle the solar panels would move to, in order to track the Sun. I handled warranty claims, remote troubleshooting, pdf and excel reporting, while also traveling once a month to perform maintenance on various sites across the US.

I recently switched to a more local battery storage facility at a competitor company and I’m having trouble coming to terms with how little work I’m doing.

I made some reports for budgeting, submitted those and my boss and his boss were praising me like crazy saying how good it looks and yet 95% of the time for the last month I’ve been sitting in my truck or walking behind the contractors looking for work to do. So really those reports were a blessing to me giving me something to do. I just don’t know how to deal with this.

I made some reports for budgeting, submitted those and my boss and his boss were praising me like crazy saying how good it looks and yet 95% of the time for the last month I’ve been sitting in my truck or walking behind the contractors looking for work to do. So really those reports were a blessing to me giving me something to do. I just don’t know how to deal with this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; old job sucked, new job I’m doing so little I feel like I’m stealing. Is it just gonna take getting used to?&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"I have, since as long as I can remember, been naturally good at art and taught myself since a young age. I have a lot of really advanced skill sets to do with drawing and painting, and am in third year of art school. During my degree however, I realised the prospect of doing any kind of Art for a career is almost impossible. I never wanted to be a gallery artist, I always wanted an actual paid job. Unlike my course mates, it isn’t the conceptual side or the challenging society side of fine art I enjoy, it’s the technical side. The challenge. The realism. I for a while was going to aim for a concept art job, or at least work towards it in the industry. Maybe environment or characters design. Although I still want to do it, the difficulty of doing so makes me want to not try at all. Google it. Read other Reddit posts. Everyone just talks about how incredibly difficult it is. 

I need a Plan B that is good enough as it has a 90% chance of becoming Plan A. Some people can make the trade of doing a really bad day job that allows them to do what they want after. I can’t. I need something at least in the middle. I can’t spend half if not more of my waking life for the next 40-50 years doing something I seriously don’t like or at least care about. It doesn’t necessarily NEED to be art related, although that idea rn seems so wild. I’ve taken art so seriously and worked so hard at it, and will have a degree in it so it’s just gonna feel like a huge waste if I didn’t pursue and succeed in it. I just need something I can get fulfilment out of. My Girlfriend works in primark, sometimes 10 hour shifts and comes home feeling so depressed, so drained and feels like she’s wasting her life. I did the same last summer. I don’t want that to be my future. 

My best idea is High School Art Teacher. Because 1. I enjoyed a lot of aspects of at least the high school environment, I can’t identify it exactly, but for some reason I miss it. A lot. 2. It’s the only job that makes my degree not utterly useless. 3. It is a professional career I can advance in and be proud of. 4. I come from a rough area, so would be more attuned to rougher schools than a lot of people. 5. Is broadly art related even if it doesn’t involve really a lot of actual drawing or painting. 6. This is double edged for me, but I get to teach kids art. Obv. I say double edged as I don’t want to teach them art and get them into the situation I’m in rn. I don’t want them in art school realising their job prospects are extremely confusing and anxiety inducing. Even then, I don’t know if teaching would provide the sense of fulfilment I need. I miss high school a lot for reasons I don’t know. I don’t know if it was the dynamic, or the fact I got on well with the teachers, or what it is. But being a teacher is very different to being a pupil, and it probably wouldn’t be in the same school or with the same people. So who’s to say it would even work. I know you’re not meant to have your life planned out at age 20, but I can’t go on with this feeling of falling off a cliff after I graduate. Like what am I doing after I grad. 

So tl;dr, I’ve spent nearly 20 years gaining a lot of technical skill in drawing and painting. Got to art school, realised even though I enjoy the degree, prospect-wise other than the simple fact it’s a degree, doesn’t provide any prospects like many other degrees.

jobs,"I know this is a good problem to have, but I have 2 offers. Offer one is for ~90k (MCOL) F500 company in an engineering position. Offer two is for ~65k (HCOLish) small company in an analytics position. I’ve become much more interested in analytics the past couple years of undergrad, and my niche experience helped me get this position. 

Offer 1:

Pros: great pay for first job in MCOL, WLB, brand name/good company

Cons: didn’t like work environment (interned), not exactly the career path I want (slightly related), did not like location

Offer 2:

Pros: great city with access to interests/hobbies, culture seems perfect, gets my foot in the door for data analytics, small company allows for potential advancement, work is in a niche I am very interested in and is hard to find 

Cons: rough pay for higher cost of living, small name company, far from home, uncertain WLB

Working in a somewhat related field for F500 gives me a good salary floor and a name brand on my resume, but the analytics job is far more interesting and worried I won’t find a similar position in the future.

jobs,"I entered my last job in the late summer of last year, and knew right away that it wasn’t the right fit. It was one of the hardest jobs I’ve had. The department required an early start time and was very stuck in its old fashioned ways (relied mostly on paper, stamping reports, scanning documents, and more). My physical and mental health suffered with a early start time and no WFH flexibility. 

After 1.5 years I have a job offer. In every sense of the word it’s a dream. It’s a remote job, I received a pay increase, in a field I want to grow in, and with my current company (which I love). I had lots of doors close, and I was distressed, distraught and confused to why other jobs didn’t open. 

It all makes sense now. And it’s the best Christmas gift I could ask for. 

For all of those searching, it’s hard and it can suck. The journey did not come without its hardships. But just know that it gets better. If you’re at a low, it will get better in one way or another and some doors close for a reason.

jobs,"After three months of being laid off and unemployed, I finally got a job at my old place of work. 

I swear I’m blacklisted at my former employer (a different university). I made a mistake and took an angry exit survey after the furlough. After that, I got rejected 15+ times (YES) for jobs I was qualified for at that university. Multiple rounds of interviews just to get the automated email that they are no longer interested.

* **Job offered me the position verbally on Friday night.** They send an employe packet and stuff saying ""welcome to the team!"" that same evening. They said they want to get the official offer letter to me by Wednesday of net week (aka 12/20). But of course that could be delayed for reasons.
* **They asked for references**, which I sent over Monday Morning.
* **Wednesday, I get a call at 11am** ( i missed it) from the job recruiter asking if we could talk. I call her back an hour later and leave her a text (since she texted me) saying I'm happy to chat and am free the rest of the day. They also only talked to one of my references.
* Nothing all Wednesday. Nothing all Thursday (left a message) Nothing all Friday.
* **I sent a follow up email to the recruiter** and the hiring team recapping that I'm happy to chat and if they need anything more from me regarding the message I got on Wednesday. But then I get an OOO message from the recruiter that is for Friday to next year.
* **At this point, I won't hear back until next year.** So i'm just waiting ... but I find it very odd that they reached out to talk and ignored all my attempts to follow up and have now gone OOO. I am trying not to worry but that level of ambiguity, ESPECIALLY since they wanted to get me hired before the new year is haunting me.
* **Am I overthinking it or is this behavior a a little strange?** I'm assuming that the recruiter wanted to tell me one of a few things on the call.
   * They need more time to get the offer letter
   * They want to review start date/salary, etc. 
   * they can't hire me for someeeeee reason (can't imagine what that would be but this is killing me)

jobs,"Tl;dr - I'm miserable at work but not qualified enough to walk into a job I think I would enjoy, I'm looking for tips that will help in job hunting/gaining experience.


Tl;dr is the top and bottom of it but I'll go into some more detail here. 
I have been working in a call centre for about a year now, I live and work in the UK, and while there are aspects of my job I really like I feel trapped. 
The salary (22.5k) is decent enough where I feel trapped from just making a change to another job, as there aren't  many  paying that much in my area that would require no experience. 
I also get bonus, and commission added to this (I've lost interest in this so if I get it I get it if I don't I don't, it's not something I'm striving for) as well as a pay increase every year.

While this would be considered shit to many, this kind of stability is something I have dreamed of, in my first job I am making more money than my mum has in any of her jobs. 

I like aspects of my job, mostly when I feel like I am able to go above and beyond for customers using knowledge of the systems and tools we have available to genuinely help them and provide improvement in their lives. 


 But I'm miserable. 

I feel anxious every time I am in office (I work predominantly from home), and it isn't an environment or job I see myself in long term. 
When I got offered the job (part time as I was still a student) I didn't even know if I wanted to take it despite knowing how much it would help with my finances. I didn't think I'd even last this long. 

I studied art , and I'm trying to put effort into that to sell prints, and other services, however I know this will not likely scale to a point where I can rely on it as a part time job, never mind full. 

Im trying to find free things I can do to add to my resume - I've applied for a course in social media marketing, as well as looking at internship/experience days with companies I am genuinely interested in working for (im lucky where if I work those hours somewhere else I can take them off during this time) 

Im not expecting to walk into my dream job, but If im working 40 hours a week I would rather not start and finish my day with dread about work. (I had three dreams about work last week alone) 


So this is me asking for advice, 

- does anyone have any tips or experience for applying to jobs where you don't have professional experience riance in that field? 

- does anyone know where some good resources are for finding opportunities to broaden your skill set and get more training? 

Any general advice would be very much appreciated, i feel like I'm drowning and every rejection that comes though (although expected) is a gut punch.",t2_6xkaj1ec,False,0,False,"I'm miserable at work, but not qualified enough to leave.","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Applications'}]",r/jobs,False,6,,0,119.61538461538461,False,t3_18pgotj,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},140.0,,False,[],,False,False,{},Applications,False,1,False,False,self,False,[],{},True,1703370341.0,richtext,6,text,self.jobs,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr - I&amp;#39;m miserable at work but not qualified enough to walk into a job I think I would enjoy, I&amp;#39;m looking for tips that will help in job hunting/gaining experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr is the top and bottom of it but I&amp;#39;ll go into some more detail here. 
I have been working in a call centre for about a year now, I live and work in the UK, and while there are aspects of my job I really like I feel trapped. 
The salary (22.5k) is decent enough where I feel trapped from just making a change to another job, as there aren&amp;#39;t  many  paying that much in my area that would require no experience. 
I also get bonus, and commission added to this (I&amp;#39;ve lost interest in this so if I get it I get it if I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s not something I&amp;#39;m striving for) as well as a pay increase every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this would be considered shit to many, this kind of stability is something I have dreamed of, in my first job I am making more money than my mum has in any of her jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like aspects of my job, mostly when I feel like I am able to go above and beyond for customers using knowledge of the systems and tools we have available to genuinely help them and provide improvement in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m miserable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel anxious every time I am in office (I work predominantly from home), and it isn&amp;#39;t an environment or job I see myself in long term. 
When I got offered the job (part time as I was still a student) I didn&amp;#39;t even know if I wanted to take it despite knowing how much it would help with my finances. I didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d even last this long. &lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"I’ll try to make this super brief but there’s a lot

Basically a few weeks ago my doctor put me on an emergency medical leave that was to be effective immediately. It was for anxiety/depression treatment and not a physical injury. I didn’t say why I was gone but my manager knows I’ve struggled with anxiety and I confided in her about a sexual harassment issue I had with a coworker (who’s now gone) and how it affected me, so I think she correctly assumes my leave was due to anxiety 

Anyway the day I came back I was met with a lot of hostility from my manager for having been on leave and because she and my coworkers “had to pick up the slack” while I was unable to work. She made a point of telling me I’m not going to get any special accommodations even though I never asked for any and I didn’t even say anything that insinuated that. I also know she badmouthed me to my colleagues when I was gone and there’s a bunch of other stuff but it would make this post too long. 

So, I will definitely be quitting this job but haven’t found a new job yet. I hate to be cowardly but after her reaction upon me coming back I am afraid she’s going to react angrily when I quit and that it’ll be an uncomfortable experience for me. She had to go through and reassign all my cases when I left and do it again when I came back and will have to do it again when I quit so I m afraid she’ll be like “ugh why did you even come back”. Also this company has been known to sometimes fire people after they give their two weeks notice.

My question is are there real repercussions to quitting without notice? I don’t ever want to come back to this company so it’s fine to burn this specific bridge and my first manager loved me so I have her to write reference.

jobs,"So I didn’t know where to post this but I figured it could go here. 

As this year comes to an end I always like to reflect. 

This time last year I had a job that I thought was my dream job making over 6 figures, WFH and great benefits. I had a grand ol plan for 2023. My birthday is the first week of January so it all comes fast for me when the year starts. 

I had plans to buy a house, double my stock portfolio and invest in an income property. 3 days before my birthday, I got laid off! Talk about blind sided. This wasn’t the first time I was laid off so I wasn’t extremely shocked but I was more in disbelief. I was a great employee best on my team and did great at my job. 

Thankfully, I saved a lot of money so I wasn’t worried financially and with my experience I was confident I could get a new job. Well I found one a week later with the same pay, but something in me didn’t sit right with the owner. 

I still accepted the role and did the job for 1 month. I ended up getting fired because an appointment cancelled and I decided not to tell him? I’ve been fired from a job before so I wasn’t too upset. Now I’ve been laid off and fire in the first month of 2023. 

I didn’t apply for unemployment the first time because I got a job right away. But when I got fired I applied for unemployment and got it. 

I was job searching, applying daily and interviewing. I didn’t find a job till May. I received 2 offers. One for a government job and the one I accepted. Both were half of what I was making in 2022. 

So after all that, I now have a job that I really enjoy! I have a chill boss my schedule is “hybrid” but there is no mandatory days I have to be in there or a specific amount of time. I just go in to check my physical mail. I asked my boss for a raise and he didn’t seem oppose to it. We have unlimited PTO as well. Work on a super small team so I’m not worried about a layoff anymore, fingers crossed.

I work at shall we say a tech shop, but we get customers who lack typical manners. 

I was serving a customer, and he wanted to sell a phone, I told him the price he’d get for it based on the condition and he wasn’t happy. Then as we went on he tried to act as if I had an attitude when I corrected. From this point on things just went left, he tried one upping by being rude and then just threw homophobic remarks and threatened me with violence (as in he was going to see me after work or punch me in the face if I kept talking) . I got nervous as I didn’t want to be punched and I allowed him to take me out of my character. He proceeded to just disrespect me and I couldn’t say much back due to me being nervous and cause I was at work.

Costco is one of the highest-ranking in revenue of all companies in the world only being beaten by Walmart and you don't make money like that if you're not exploiting your workforce.

* Terrible scheduling hours. People work for almost a decade before being able to work reasonable hours. Even though the store closes ""earlier"" than other retail outlets people are scheduled to work into the night and this is not made clear at hire ever it seems.
* To save money Costco does not have security. Management expects people to police, guard &amp; survail indoors and outdoor, and stop theft with no training or additional pay.
* Many workers have severe physical disabilities from the hard physical labor like arthritis, CT, back/spine problems, etc. Lack of reasonable accommodation for employees disabled from the job.
* They claim to have flexible hours but that is not true. You must work 5 days a week minimum 5 hours a day. There is no flexibility in hours.
* If you are a student, management will use manipulative tactics and tell employees they don't need to go to college to keep staff.
* They are lying about turnover. The turnover is incredibly high.
* They deny workers comp claims like crazy when there is scientific evidence that repeat physical labor is damaging to the body.
* I have met people who experienced SA at work and their perpetrators were never fired but instead transferred to other locations.
* Breaks are not given on time or at all.
* No training, serious work injuries. Working in the industrial kitchen area is incredibly dangerous and the risks are not made clear at hire.

jobs,"Hey all, I work in a shop with a retail element and technical repair element. A few months ago my boss (Sam) hired his son (Dave) into the technical repair team with the directive that I would train him on repair. Dave consistently works retail when he is needed in repairs, and it screws us over. We should have a technician in training, and instead we’ve got a kid who won’t work in repairs. 

Recently, Dave told me directly that rules don’t apply to him because his “dad runs this shop.” I don’t know how to tell him “Dave, you are expected to work in repairs, not retail” because the last time I told him to knock it off, he called his dad and his dad chewed me out for being mean to Dave. 

There are 12 folks working in repair. 11/12 are planning to leave because of Dave, and Sam’s unwillingness to handle him. 11/12 have cut back their hours significantly and started working other jobs. Softly quitting, if you will. 

I’m fed up of him. The people working retail are fed up because of their own reasons that are not relevant vent to this post. 

What do I do? 

I’m also looking for other jobs. My skillset is incredibly rare in this field, and if I quit I am single handedly screwing over Sam so hard the repair element of the shop is likely to fail outright. My coworkers know this, Sam does not.

jobs,"A little backstory, I started working for a medical supply company a little bit over 2 months ago; after struggling to find a stable job where I felt comfortable ever since the covid debacle. It's a pretty small operation with a staff of maybe 18 people, despite this they're doing quite well as a supplier for major hospital groups, private practices, government agencies, etc. 

Last week they were doing performance reviews for the entire staff, but since I'm still under the law required 90-day probation period I thought I'd be skipped over until that period is done by mid-January.  Turns out I was called into the owner's office and he said he was impressed by my performance thus far, he even thought I had been there longer than I actually had because of it. He didn't really go through with an actual review and said he'd wait until January for it, he ended the conversation by saying he'd still throw a couple bucks my way as a thank you. 

Well, yesterday morning I was doing a routine check of my bank account and found out he gave me $500, the same amount he gave everyone else with tenure on the company! On top of that my supervisor blessed me with $100 on the side as a token of his appreciation. 

Point of the story is; I know there's a lot of awful employers and things can be really tough, but if you find yourself in a position where you get hired by people who are at their core decent individuals, doing your best and making a legitimate effort at being a good employee may lead to unexpected blessings coming your way.

jobs,"Hello, looking for advice on requesting a pay increase in a rather unusual situation. I have been in my role for two years and was selected by my bosses boss to become a team lead with a new manager. I got my brother hired one month ago for the same role I am in(not a team lead), but on a separate team. 

He was hired on a salary at 57K about 5500 less than me at 62.5K. I started at 52.5K 2 years ago.

He just got an email today that he is getting a pay adjustment of over 10K to 67.7K and he now will be making 5K more than me, despite having no experience in the role. This is due to him living in Washington and us being exempt employees who work overtime. He had his pay adjusted to meet the minimum for the salary threshold for exempt employees. 

I live in Florida, so no such law applies to me.

I have been in my role for two years and was selected by my bosses boss to become a team lead with a new manager. I got my brother hired one month ago for the same role I am in(not a team lead), but on a separate team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was hired on a salary at 57K about 5500 less than me at 62.5K. I started at 52.5K 2 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He just got an email today that he is getting a pay adjustment of over 10K to 67.7K and he now will be making 5K more than me, despite having no experience in the role. This is due to him living in Washington and us being exempt employees who work overtime. He had his pay adjusted to meet the minimum for the salary threshold for exempt employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Florida, so no such law applies to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it rather unfair that I worked hard to increase my base salary 10K over 2 years and just because he happens to live in Washington he gets to start at over 15k than I started at.

When I interviewed, my role was fully in-office. Except, I’m a single mom to a 6yo. She’s gotten sick and gotten me sick. Holidays, etc.
I have had a ton of flexibility and freedom because I’m a high performer. 

We had our company party last week. We all got silly gifts but I also got a $1,500 Christmas bonus (mind you, I’ve only been there three months) and PTO from today until January 2nd.

jobs,"I have missed a few days of work this week due to being sick. On Friday (today, Dec. 22), I notified my manager that ""I don't think that I can make it in today"", but asked if I could make up hours over the weekend (which can be completed in the office or at home). She replied, ""I think it would be best if you get some rest and get well"". In this conversation, she also suggested that I go to urgent care to get tested. Since I am a single mother and have missed so much work, I decided to go in and complete the remainder (about 6/8 hours) of my scheduled shift. 

As soon as I arrived, my manager asked me if I had gone to the doctor, or had been tested - which I had not. I then was pulled into her manager's office, where I was told (with both managers present), that I was being selfish by exposing my coworkers and disregarding my manager's instructions/decisions. I was also told to go home and take my laptop to make up hours over the weekend as a courtesy (note: no specific amount of hours was established). I did not say a word during this entire conversation to avoid any further issues.

After leaving work, I messaged my manager asking for email confirmation regarding my approval to work at home this weekend. They have previously gotten other employees in trouble after verbally approving something, but not putting it in writing - so I figured it best to get written confirmation. My manager sent me an email stating that I could make up today's hours (Dec. 22) over Saturday and Sunday. I was frustrated by this, considering I had missed around 24 hours of work this week (if Friday is included). However, I did not reply to this email and accepted that 8 hours is better than none.

I then receive an email from my manager's manager replying to this email, stating the following:

*To place the circumstances surrounding this situation in writing, the decision to allow you to make up hours for Friday 12/22/23 was made after coming into work following a prior discussion this morning via teams between yourself and* \[my manager\] *that you were to stay home due to the possibility of said illness. After showing up to work at 9:15, we discussed the issue surrounding the health of your coworkers and disregard for management direction as well as going to the doctor to be checked. To be clear, decisions made by management are final and each request is taken on a case-by-case basis.* 

Not only was I disturbed by her run-on sentences, but also by the fact that she CC'd the manager above her (who is also the department head). After carefully reading my teams messages and this email, I decided to email back in a firm but respectful manner:

*I do appreciate you allowing me to make up the hours for today (Friday, Dec. 22) over the course of the weekend.*

*For further clarification, I did not specifically state that I was not coming in, nor was I specifically told not to. I stated that ""I do not* ***think*** *I'm going to make it in today"", leaving my final decision out of the equation. The decision to come in for my scheduled shift today was over the concern that I may not only fall behind financially, but also professionally.* 

*I am sorry for any inconvenience caused, and any possible exposure to my unknown illness. But I hope that you can understand my intentions to maintain my professional development by owning my work, as well as provide for myself and my daughter.* 

It's important to note that in every meeting with the department head, he emphasizes that we need to ""own our work"".

I have not received a reply to this email, but my coworker told me that she heard my managers quietly discussing it - of which she could not make out the details. I wanted to make see if they would have any viable reason to write me up or even fire me, or if this is something I should take to HR.

jobs,"I am on good terms with my manager, she's the one who actually asked me if I want to work for her and hired me, but at the end of the day she's still my manager professionally and I don't want to alienate her or say something that can be used against me or harm my rapport/reputation with her.

I work as a personal trainer four days a week, and recently switched to three days - taking on both morning and evening shifts and cramming it into those 3 days in a row.

Usually the manager doesn't need an explanation on my shifts, but she said there is no one working the shifts on the two weekdays that I am off, and asked me why I decided to switch to the three days.

My actual reasons: I am in the military reserves and we do drill weekend, so I will be off for two weekdays. If I have regular clients and they want to book on those days, it won't be as reliable since I drill once a month. I also want to cram three days and have the rest of the week off to do medical appointments and other errands where I don't have to worry about coming in. My manager sends me leads for my shifts, but I want to be able to have more control over who I see over the off-weekdays instead of having my manager make the appointments for me. I usually don't tell employers that I am in the military reserve because military has a bad reputation in my area and I noticed that I get more calls back if I leave my veteran status off my demographic information. She may already know I am in the reserves and not care though, she's seen me around the studio for like two years before approaching me and asking me if I want to work for her.

What are some safe things to tell her? I am also worried that being an unmarried childless woman, I will be expected to be more available even though technically we're not allowed to treat employees differently based on family status but we all know that we do.

The things I am thinking of telling her: I have family commitments and another part time job that won't make the off-weekdays reliable. I leave town often during those days, about once a month. So I thought a schedule with day and evening shifts during the first three weekdays will be more reliable, while I can come in on the off-days depending on case-by-case basis (for example a client only has a certain evening available, then I can try to work with her)

I handle the claims appropriately and I take everything she tells me seriously, but it’s getting to the point where my male employees are scared to go near her out of fear she’ll say they harassed her.

A little back story: 

I have worked with the company for 2 1/2 years now. 

I have always been told the bonus is based off of years worked at the company 
 
My boss just started here around 6 months ago
 
Also my husband had a little disagreement with said boss a few months ago 

When Christmas bonuses came out I was surprised I got so much LESS than last years. 

When asked other employees (who have worked LESS years then me and got significantly MORE than me) 

I confront the boss and she said it wasn’t her decision and based off of how many hours worked through the year (even tho that wouldn’t even add up when I talked to what other people got)

She is very personable and says that this is something she does as a ""side hustle"" to her current full-time position as well and she has been doing it for 6-7 months. We are all located in the same city and she often meets in person with the team.

She goes on to explain the job and asks about my background as well. She says there is no need for any cold calling or prospecting, all of that is done by the person who originally contacted me via LinkedIn. She says he loves that part of the business and he has been doing it for so long that he has perfected the process.

She says I am a great fit and offers me the position and has me sign up on the World Financial Group website and I pay $125.

She follows this with an email of an orientation which consists of 8 videos of the person who contacted me via LinkedIn explaining how we help people and make a living off of it.

I have an orientation on Tuesday with the girl who interviewed/hire me. What do you guys think?

jobs,"Hello everyone.

Backgorund: I'm an IT graduate in Sydney, Aus on post-study visa (485) currently working in a company as a junior ruby on rails developer and I do some IT support as well. I get paid 50k with no benefits which is clearly very less for what I do. The company doesn't believe in spending resources on employees or technologies. They still use old technologies and dont even have proper ticking systems as they dont want to pay for it so all the communication happens via email. I have asked for raise several times but there has been no
proper response. Due to this I still have to work weekends at a cafe to atleast meet my income requirements for general expenses like rent and groceries.

In meantime I have realised I don't want to progress my career towards development side and wants to more forward towards IT infrastructure. So I did some certifications like Google IT support professional and some udemy and linkedln courses which will help me learn more in this area and l improve my resume.

As a result, I am applying for new roles as entry level service desk and Junior infrastructure engineer roles. I have applied atleast 120 jobs and got rejected most of them. Got 2-3 interviews but they weren't successful. This is after editing my resume for each of them according to the job description and ATS match. 

I could not apply any jobs as I got rejected straight as I didn't have any visa left but my visa got extended 2 more years so I started applying again 3 months ago. Can this be a reason as I have been told often that they would like to hire someone who is permanent resident or citizen?

I was doing the same tasks for all of that time until this summer, when I was approached by my immediate supervisor and asked to apply for an open position in the department because they thought I would be a good fit.

Eager to do more in a job that I really like, I was flattered. I applied, got the promotion, and have been in my new role since August. I have the same team, but new responsibilities that are out of the scope of things I have done before.

There are lots of things that don't get passed on to me because either they assume I already know, it is discussed in-office on my days off, or my immediate supervisor just plain forgets. I ask questions when I have them (which is very, very often), but most of the time, I don't know that I didn't know something until it's too late.

No one has said anything to me about it other than very nicely correcting me when I've said something wrong, but I'm an anxious person and fear I'm in over my head and look stupid.

I know a lot of people have been struggling just like me, but I just don’t know what to do now to get my foot in the door anywhere.

Inspired by my own life and by many posts from this community, I made episode 1 of an animation series that has the theme of having a hard time finding a job in the current market and the leverage it gives to employers. 

Season 1 will have 7 episodes. 
Episode 1 is [here. ](https://youtube.com/shorts/WftW08V7Hyk?si=hg9vow_K6v9SXjTA)

&lt;p&gt;Season 1 will have 7 episodes.

Hey all,

My boss is planning to formally promote me to a country manager. Ive suceeded in my role throughout these 3 years and will be taking on more responsibilities. She did mention my compensation would be increased but we have so much (pressing) topics to discuss during our conversations. Yes I believe Ive done well assesing my accomplishments and from boss + peer feedback

Im torn on how to bring this up when this topic is discussed again. On one end, something tells me an easy ""Can we please discuss compensation?"" and ask what will it be, but the next question is how do you now bring up a certain number if it's not in the ballpark?

During the 3 yrs Ive gotten paid 20% less than industry standard, but with the new position my idea is to bring it up to 35%. It's a big jump but do consider Ive only gotten 1 raise + getting paid under industry norms the past 3 years

Because of my experience at McDonald’s as a manager, I landed a job as a shift lead at Wendy’s, assistant manager at Dominos, Cook at Ruby Tuesday’s (with a push for management), and what I’m working now, Kitchen at Raisin Cane’s.

Cane’s is scheduling me one day a week so they’re first on the chopping block, I haven’t heard anything back in two weeks now from Dominos, I have to wait until after Christmas for Wendy’s to move forward on training and whatnot, and while Ruby Tuesdays have been the most active, looks like ill start there after Christmas too since I haven't gotten my onboarding stuff in time for work next week.

I applied to my literal dream job at a university about 2 months ago. They took about a month to respond to ask me in for an interview. Interview went not bad I was extremely nervous, but I prepared for it for days.

Did well enough to make it to a technical test. Took me basically all day. Presented it to them. Did well on that.

They emailed me and told me I was the preferred candidate and they were looking to move ahead with my application. But they needed to check my background/education/references. No problem.

They only accept supervisory references, so I only list those. They ask for my current boss. I give him as a reference despite how fucking awkward that is. He agrees, and has already replaced me through this whole process. They schedule a call with him, and then miss that call. 

I submitted and did all of this shit early December. It is now the Friday headed into the holidays and I don’t have a fucking straight answer or offer yet. I followed up last week, and they told me they’d have an answer by the end of this week.

jobs,"So I happen to have an extremely gappy CV. It's very embarrassing and I've realised I can't just explain it away with generic platitudes.

I just had an interview for a job I'd really like at an international NGO and they asked me about the multiple gaps in my CV.

For context, I have a gap between 2015 and 2018, one between 2020 and 2021, and one between last January and today. ""Personal issues"" doesn't work as an excuse for three different gaps, and of course I couldn't just say ""mind your own business"" even though I believe that recruiters shouldn't ask about this.

So I told them that the first gap was due to me unsuccessfully looking for a job after my first M.Sc., due to the bad economic crisis going on in my country, then volunteering for a while, then applying for a second M.Sc. and finally getting admitted and spending the last months of 2017 preparing to move.

For 2020-21 I used the excuse of Covid preventing me from finding a job right after graduating from my second MSc.

Then since last January I kept looking for a job at the UN (I interned at the UN in 2022), without realising how long the hiring processes in this field can be, and how tough it can be for junior profiles to land a job in this sector, which made me waste time, then summer came and everything came to a halt - so basically I've only been truly looking for jobs for three months. I honestly and bluntly said ""the difficulty of finding a job in this field took me by surprise and unfortunately caused me to waste some time by not making best use of my qualifications and network"". (To be fair, it *is* well known that finding a job in INGOs for a junior is extremely difficult, to the point that most people reply ""yeah it's not you it's the system, just keep applying"" and months of unemployment are near normal.)

Nothing about this is false. It's all technically true. I did omit a few things, like the fact that the 2015-17 gap would probably have been smaller weren't I hit by unemployment-related crippling depression that made me unable to leave my room.

How does all of this sound to a recruiter? I keep hoping that if they interviewed me for this job it means they think I might be a good fit even despite these gaps, but I wonder how all of this comes across to a recruiter. I honestly don't have any better excuses, I felt that mentioning generic personal or family issues would have sounded fake, so I try to be as honest as I can while maintaining professionalism and integrity and not sounding like a clueless mess who just doesn't like to work.

jobs,"I work with a bunch of people that help kids or adults that are on the spectrum or are struggling in life. We sometimes pick them up and drive them to an event or just get them out of the house and show them that life is great and grand! (Truly a rewarding job!)


But......my co workers absolutely suck at communication! Like the fucking worst! We have 1 person in charge of a case or client and several others under that person. That 1 person incharge delegates and makes sure the client is being seen by who they should be and they're day is filled as much as possible. 


The issue is there is no team in this place. The person in charge will have several messages that include 1 person below them and what they need done or need to do. No group text with everyone on that case in it. Etc. So there are days where I'm with a client and someone is suppose to pick him up and I have no info about this until the person shows up. Now why wouldn't the client just tell me? It isn't their job plus sometimes we have people who Sadly can barely manage to do self care tasks daily let alone tell me who's picking them up.



Sometimes it backfires and I've taken a client back home only to find out 20 mins later a co worker is at our office to pick up that client. Email is dismal to say the least, almost none of them reply or even let anyone know what's happening. The ""Maintenance guy"" doesn't tell anyone when someone is coming down and what office so we've missed appointments/had 1 person there that has no idea what is going on to tell the worker who also......has no idea of what is happening. 


I've tried emailing everyone in my group and sent out group text messages. Most of them go ignored or we use that for several days before it goes unused. My boss is super good and nice. she actually communicates and gets shit done but everyone else just fumbles around like a chicken with their head cut off. She has said if you have a problem with someone then talk to them about it, don't come to me to bitch come to me with solutions.


So I kinda feel like I'm out in the middle of an ocean by myself. I rant, rave and wave my hands around (figuratively) to get some communication but it's severely lacking. What can I do? For the record I'm not interested in leaving, there is no HR (well the boss is really), only 1 person really dislikes me (that I know of) because I ""stole"" her sisters job.

We sometimes pick them up and drive them to an event or just get them out of the house and show them that life is great and grand! (Truly a rewarding job!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But......my co workers absolutely suck at communication! Like the fucking worst! We have 1 person in charge of a case or client and several others under that person. That 1 person incharge delegates and makes sure the client is being seen by who they should be and they&amp;#39;re day is filled as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is there is no team in this place. The person in charge will have several messages that include 1 person below them and what they need done or need to do. No group text with everyone on that case in it. Etc. So there are days where I&amp;#39;m with a client and someone is suppose to pick him up and I have no info about this until the person shows up. Now why wouldn&amp;#39;t the client just tell me? It isn&amp;#39;t their job plus sometimes we have people who Sadly can barely manage to do self care tasks daily let alone tell me who&amp;#39;s picking them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it backfires and I&amp;#39;ve taken a client back home only to find out 20 mins later a co worker is at our office to pick up that client. Email is dismal to say the least, almost none of them reply or even let anyone know what&amp;#39;s happening. The &amp;quot;Maintenance guy&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t tell anyone when someone is coming down and what office so we&amp;#39;ve missed appointments/had 1 person there that has no idea what is going on to tell the worker who also......has no idea of what is happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried emailing everyone in my group and sent out group text messages. Most of them go ignored or we use that for several days before it goes unused. My boss is super good and nice. she actually communicates and gets shit done but everyone else just fumbles around like a chicken with their head cut off. She has said if you have a problem with someone then talk to them about it, don&amp;#39;t come to me to bitch come to me with solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I kinda feel like I&amp;#39;m out in the middle of an ocean by myself. I rant, rave and wave my hands around (figuratively) to get some communication but it&amp;#39;s severely lacking. What can I do? For the record I&amp;#39;m not interested in leaving, there is no HR (well the boss is really), only 1 person really dislikes me (that I know of) because I &amp;quot;stole&amp;quot; her sisters job. The boss offered me the position I simply applied. I have no idea who their sister even is. Thankfully I don&amp;#39;t work with her on any cases and just pass in the hall occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"Hey. So i just joined this community hope this isnt off topic.

So a applied for a job a month ago and they called and asked when i can start.( i said January 1st)

2 weeks later they asked if im still up to the job and i said sure why not. They said they'll contact me before Christmas with details about the job.

Today they called me again but i changed my mind and dont want to go work there anymore. 

I did not pick up the phone when they called. 

Should i pick up next time they call and say i dont want to work there anymore?

Or is it okay to ghost them ? 

It's a job anyone can apply to and it's in a different country than i am.

I am young and inexperienced so would appreciate all the tips.

Edit : I called back and said im not interested. 
         She was very sweet and said it's okay and that was that.
         Thanks to everyone for the advice.

jobs,"TLDR - sales related job. 5 different tiers for performance goals. Very few in highest tier are achieving 100% to goal, while mid tier people can put up half the numbers of tier 1, but show 200%+ to their goal. Bonuses paid out on overachieving at the end of the year. 

This will probably be a bit long, as I have a lot of stress and anxiety to get off my chest, but I'll try to keep it brief. I've worked at my company for close to 10 years, but a couple years ago, they went through significant changes. Basically a complete overhaul of our product/service, built from the ground up. The new product is honestly garbage and everyone, including management, knows it. With the growing pains of the new subpar product, they've implemented a new performance metric and comp plan. 5 different tiers, tier 1 being highest. 
- tier 1: 10k points
- tier 2: 6.5k points
- tier 3: 3.5k points
- tier 4: 2k points
- tier 5: 100 points (not a typo!) 

There are 4 other performance metrics, but the above tiers carry the most weight (75%). All metrics combined give a cumulative score. 
I'm going to oversimplify it a bit, but essentially you can have a tier 1 rep with 8 sales for the month be at 80% to goal and if they have a slow month and fall below 80%, that rep can be written up and fired if they miss 3 months in a calendar year. While a tier 3 rep has 7 sales and be at 200%. Tier 5 rep can literally have 1 sale and be well over 100% for the ENTIRE YEAR! Here's the real kick in the pants... A tier 5 rep  I know is making $15k more in base pay than me and DOUBLE the annual bonus that I'm eligible for. 

I'm at tier 1, but have managed to stay just over 100% year to date... Until I couldn't take it anymore. For the first time in my life, I decided to go on LOA. The final straw was getting written up in October for being at 70% in July. To add more salt to the wound... 
- Q3 sales goals weren't even revealed to us until 2nd week of August. 
- beginning 2023, they announced that our performance is no longer tracked on monthly basis, but quarterly. I finished Q3 above the required minimum 80%.
- I was out on LOA for 2 months and just returned this week and now being told I'm still liable for making up any gaps for end of year performance.
- I previously requested a transfer out of state and was promised they'll make it happen. Granted, I keep up with my performance. Was given a choice of transfer in Q4 '23 or Q1' 24, but encouraged to stay and finish out the year to both help the team and increase my chances of a end of year bonus. 

Tier placement of reps is determined by management on several factors. Or so they say... I've argued with them about being placed at tier 1 and every reason they've given me why they placee me in tier 1 is false. So they just fall back to encouragement, ""you can do it, I believe in you, I'm here to support you anyway I can, etc."" Some of the people in tier 3 are the most tenured, consistent strong performers, and in highly desirable markets. It's all a mess... at least 1/3 of the team has gone on leave for 3+ months at some point this year, even my direct manager.

jobs,"Hi All,

Really need your advice on a potential Job Switch. So I have been working at this large MNC since my graduation. (3 years now) I really have loved the work and there was initially a lot of learning for me, not that much anymore.  The job however, is in a different city and ever since covid restrictions relaxed we have been following a hybrid model. I however, had been given especial freedom by my ex-Boss where in I come to office for two weeks and then wfh the rest of two weeks. My Boss however, recently changed and the new Boss is a micromanager.  Wants everyone to come to office no matter if you are more than getting the work done from home. This led us to having a huge argument two months ago where I asked to go an annual leaves but was refused + humiliated on account that I already work from home a lot. It got so bad that I decided then and there that I would resign even without a new job offer. 

However, my department head caught wind of all this happening and personally talked and apologized to me about the incident. He assured me I can take the entire month off if I need to (I needed the time to work on my graduate apps and retake some exams)  and was very supportive of a even more relaxed future hybrid model since they know am planning for grad school. I also talked to my ex-Boss who already had a standing offer for me to move to his time on my return.  My ex-Boss is a really good leader, gives you absolute freedom to work on your own pace and just cares about the work getting done not how. I have enjoyed working in him in past but the team he leads now isn't doing the kind of work I am very interested in. There is no new learning for me there.

Now during my annuals a company reached out to be on linkedIn for a senior data engineer position. (currently a data engineer). I ended up giving the interviews and they placed an offer. Here is a comparison of the two companies.

**New Company**

* In my home city so expenses extremely low, however, very stringent about coming to office every day. Got a very serious authoritative  vibe from the manager during interview
* Has none of the benefits that the MNC offers as smaller company but I got it adjusted in my gross salary. All in all almost 10% increase on my current package with lesser expenses. Not paying for rent etc.
* Use a different technology stack so greater opportunity for learning
* Team has no gender diversification (I am first female joining)

**Current Company**

* Will be working with my previous Boss who is extremely good manager
* A very recognizable name in industry
* Very high expenses
* Not a lot of learning now (been here for 3 years)

jobs,"Hey everyone, I could really use some guidance here. I'm set to graduate in March, and recently, I had a job offer from a certain tech consulting company (below big 4) for a Business Analyst role after going through three interviews. But things took an unexpected turn during the offer meeting.  
They mentioned feeling I might be a better fit for an engineer position and asked me to consider it. Keen on knowing more, I requested details about the engineer role. The recruiter scheduled a video meeting, but surprise – it was another interview, this time with an engineer from their team.  
Then, just this Monday, they scheduled another meeting, this time only with my second interviewer. When I reiterated my preference for the business analyst position, I was hit with unexpected news. They mentioned a lack of headcount for the business analyst role and, unfortunately, rescinded the offer altogether.  
Here's the kicker – I turned down four other offers for this position, and now I'm left with no job offer just three months shy of graduation. I'm feeling devastated and disrespected by this turn of events.

The second interviewer told me he'd talk to the upper management for an extra position in the Business analyst team and he'd get back to me by the end of January and that I could take the offer then if it still stands, but I don't have much hope for it to be honest.

I'm at a loss for what to do. Should I reach out to them via email? I feel utterly lost and unsure of my next steps. This whole process cost me a month, and now I'm going into finals.

Hi Im 23F, fresh grad, i have work 8-5 which is fairly okayish job, nothing much to do BUT very low salary. This is my first job and im not satisfied with it.

jobs,"Is randsrad really hiring? They seem to be the best for staffing agencies. 

And if not, is anyone else hiring quick besides fast-food. I have advanced degrees and multi-industry experience. I applied to Walmart and didn't hear back. Does anyone know how to get hired there? I walked in and gave the manager my phone number. I didn't hear back. 

I need office work. I'm not in the best area that values education and learning and a multidisciplinary background. 

I can't get hired at Amazon or UPS because I am unable to perform heavy manual work.

Some said USPS. I applied. But I don't know what they pay. They do background checks that are very thorough. I have nothing in my background but that tells me it takes a long time to get hired. 

Applications are done online on their websites. But they only call you if they find a match with their client employer 

The client employer makes the decisions to hire. If a candidate is overqualified they likely won't bring them in. I can't dumb myself down. I think a certain way based on my multi-industry experience. My training was in different areas of business, not Govt.

But some middle aged people have challenges getting hired, particularly women. I am also in an area of the U.S. where most people put family first and education last. And I did the opposite. Not everyone us accepted everywhere they go.

They seem to be the best for staffing agencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if not, is anyone else hiring quick besides fast-food. I have advanced degrees and multi-industry experience. I applied to Walmart and didn&amp;#39;t hear back. Does anyone know how to get hired there? I walked in and gave the manager my phone number. I didn&amp;#39;t hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need office work. I&amp;#39;m not in the best area that values education and learning and a multidisciplinary background. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t get hired at Amazon or UPS because I am unable to perform heavy manual work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some said USPS. I applied. But I don&amp;#39;t know what they pay. They do background checks that are very thorough. I have nothing in my background but that tells me it takes a long time to get hired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications are done online on their websites. But they only call you if they find a match with their client employer &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client employer makes the decisions to hire. If a candidate is overqualified they likely won&amp;#39;t bring them in. I can&amp;#39;t dumb myself down. I think a certain way based on my multi-industry experience. My training was in different areas of business, not Govt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some middle aged people have challenges getting hired, particularly women. I am also in an area of the U.S. where most people put family first and education last. And I did the opposite. Not everyone us accepted everywhere they go. &lt;/p&gt;

Well, fast forward 4 weeks and none of it has happened. After I didn't get my raise I brought it up and was told he would have to talk to payroll.

I need to get this off my chest. I started a new job and my colleague is assigned to train me. This is a completely new career field to me. I’ve been taking down notes of everything my colleague is training me on. 

My colleague showed me a template and an example of previous work documents(it’s not even their own example of work document, should’ve been a red flag to me). So I assumed this is the correct way. 

Today the big meeting happened. I completed the work document exactly as instructed. I take time to clean it up before sending it to my line manager. My colleague RUSHES me. They ping me by the minute and told me to send it ASAP to my line manager. I told them I need to clean it up. They said it’s fine to just send it right now. 

Thus, I turn it in to my line manager. My line manager then instructs me to clean it up before ever turning it in. Then my colleague turns in their work document and it’s COMPLETELY different way than the sample they showed me!

Hi! I'm a guy looking for a remote job. preferably as a web designer/developer or customer services. But heck i'm desperate and down for anything really.

 **What are your strengths and weaknesses?**

I'm a manipulative character, I will work hard on convincing you that i can do something more than working on the actual thing.

 **Can you describe a challenging situation you've faced at work and how you handled it?** 

Couldn't write the logic of a function so i used Chatgpt. ( previously stackoverflow )

 **Where do you see yourself in five years?**

I hate that question.

 **Why should we hire you?**

you shouldn't really, I don't have a portfolio and never cared enough to do one, you just have to trust me. i do have a linkedin profile though.

 **What is your greatest professional achievement?**

since i learned web development i only did html,css and asp net, found a project on a freelancing website asking for a Reactjs web app with nodejs. I applied anyway, told him that I've been working with react for almost 2 years and I didn't even know how to write javascript. I got accepted and i had a month and a half deadline for the job. I learned js and react in a month and built the website in the remaining duration.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe a challenging situation you&amp;#39;ve faced at work and how you handled it?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couldn&amp;#39;t write the logic of a function so i used Chatgpt. ( previously stackoverflow )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you see yourself in five years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate that question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should we hire you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you shouldn&amp;#39;t really, I don&amp;#39;t have a portfolio and never cared enough to do one, you just have to trust me. i do have a linkedin profile though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your greatest professional achievement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since i learned web development i only did html,css and asp net, found a project on a freelancing website asking for a Reactjs web app with nodejs. I applied anyway, told him that I&amp;#39;ve been working with react for almost 2 years and I didn&amp;#39;t even know how to write javascript. I got accepted and i had a month and a half deadline for the job. I learned js and react in a month and built the website in the remaining duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about a time you worked in a team.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;none, most are freelance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any questions for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please hire me.&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"sorry for length, spooling vent below. 


I was laid off in August and I'm a few weeks into a *terrible* job with a massive paycut for the ""training period"" - I have my ""touchbase"" with HR in January. It's remote. I'm dreading it. I've grown to hate HR people - the middleman that will give me bad news, that's what I'm imagining. No offense to HR people of this sub, but from this, HR generally seems to exist to immiserate employees and enable the company in disposing of them and making them unhappy, in addition to justifying its existence by sourcing candidates, giving desperate people like me false hope, and then dismissing them in the candidate search. 

Today I had to do tasks for end-of-month alone and just...my manager goes on vacation tomorrow, it's right before Christmas...he didn't even zoom call me today. I worked without feedback the whole fuckin' day, for a very important task. I painstakingly went through it and every time I asked questions he just seemed frustrated. I know he had other stuff to do, *but if you're going to fire for fucking something up*, I could benefit from clear direction. Even before a holiday. 


I feel *unbearably* paranoid after being laid off and exposed to an otherwise very nice person's grouchy side by end of day. It's been six weeks and he's clearly frustrated, even if a task is new. There's no way to talk about it either. It's like telling a great white shark you're afraid they're going to eat you - planting the idea by stating the obvious. 

I'm going to say it - companies seem more adversarial than ever to their employees. I guess I'm used to it, but not quite like this, this continuously. Every time I start a new job, it really does seem worse. Something changed with lockdown too. I see the posts from people that talk about starting new jobs after a devastating layoff months before, only to be fired again; and there's no way to assess it, especially if you're the sort of person managers just don't value or like. 

If you lack the certifications, software skills and smarts as a retiring, unappealing, quiet person, the only way to survive is through more and more hard skills, with each vice. I lack them. I have soft skills, but probably look and come off like a ""stereotypical STEM"" personality...yet none of the skills that excuse that. It's a bad combo. (This doesn't mean I don't make small talk but I don't want to talk about my personal life anymore...during the workday, I'm just tired. I just want to work.)

I have lived my life around unemployment and the continuous fear of being fired (partially related to years of being relegated to temping agencies). 

This job is baldly exploitative and pays as much as a temp job after the summer layoff. It's actually somewhat difficult sales support work but they're paying near minimum wage in my state. It just makes me fucking furious and ashamed of all the interviews in the last two years for jobs that still paid 20% lower than my previous salary that rejected me, after decent-seeming interviews and when I fit the bill for experience. 

I'm already in tears at least once a week and furiously angry at the lack of feedback because I think I'm trying pretty hard, but the silence seems like frustration - for asking too many questions to seem like I'm ready to work/absorbing the routine, to not fuck up...all of it. And anxiety makes doing simple tasks seem torturous, because of course, little mistakes become a big deal too. *My previous laying off manager has fucking destroyed my ability to be comfortable in a new job*, as insult laid upon injury. When I think of the big, nasty smile on his face when I was dropping off company property, I want to strangle him. 

It creates a negative feedback loop that makes getting through the workday hard on that count too: I reflect that I have never worked in a job when I didn't feel like the stupidest person in an office (and probably am), unlike other people. It comes easily with doing administrative work, as admin/general office work is either limited to very bubbly, high energy, and/or senior people and then a tech team, a finance team, etc. and, yeah, maybe being stupid. I've never been important enough to train closely or valued closely. And learning the task of every new job seems harder and harder. Not just because it's like learning to read again - with each year I'm alive, after bad experiences, every day is filled with *paranoia* of incoming firing. The stress. The trauma. Fuck me, I wish I could win the lottery just to not experience what this is doing to me physically, what the expectation to go to office has done my whole life. To not go through the humiliation of interviewing and sending agonized-over ""thank you notes"" quickly followed by the slap in the face of a rejection 2 hours later (happened today after a decent seeming first round with a nice outgoing retiree).  

I should be an excel expert right now. Having to do it in a new context exposes that the only thing I've really mastered is basic keyboard tricks and vlookup. Nothing in a ""serious"" job for accounting, making tables, creating proposals. But that isn't the (only) problem...it's the humiliation of feeling too important for a *better*, more valuable job than this, where I'm not treated like a nuisance for asking for feedback on my work. Where I'm skilled and important enough to be kept, instead of being in the cluster of jobs/people that can be eliminated or replaced.

...I have never been rewarded for loyalty and my best is never good enough. Ever. 

When I think about the humiliation of being fired from a job paying something like 55% of my previous salary, I want to scream. I feel so helpless. 

Try too hard, struggle to much, show the effort in a new, unfamiliar job and in an era anyone that needs to be trained on new tasks is DOA - look like a fucking idiot, piss off your manager, seem like a needy dumbshit - get fired. Be isolated in complete shame, self-respect, and from work/being trained to acquire new knowledge again.

Be passive and paralyzed with uncertainty and the desire not to look stupid when you're not being trained, when you go hours without clear direction every day, and the day's or week's expectations are uncertain - get fired. 

Work in a ""new role"" at the bottom, paid like shit, *because you are desperate and humiliated* and the sort of person in this economy that can have a college degree, a fair amount of experience and education in your field (sales support)....get fired. Be perpetually fireable. 

Do any of you relate? 

And it's not just being or feeling stupid that's a torture...I can never ascend. 



There is no life apart to be lived from this. If you feel like a failure and like your life is built on the uncertain ground of aging while underemployed for your entire career, in spite of trying to acquire more skills on the cheap while working...it's never enough. And yes, you start to take it all personally, the judgment you don't deserve to feed and clothe yourself, that your best efforts to contribute are no good. (I know how stupid and pathetic this is! It's the truth. I'd like to at least say I am employed. The only people and companies that employ me make me think I'd be better off dead - no need to pay rent that way. I have nothing else to live for and no sources of happiness. I live hand to mouth in jobs nobody I went to school with or grew up with would take, or have to take. It's completely impossibly not to internalize with terror and shame.) 

It's always been this way, since college. If you're really bad at the most important arena of your life - school/work - it precludes talking about yourself to people truthfully. It's impossible to make new friends, or be around people, because the truth is unbearable. 

It makes it harder and harder to be with anyone you ""know"". And the work, the stress, the sweaty pathetic scrounging and never getting anyplace better taking up so much time, in the place of *living a normal life*, with relationships and pleasure - going to fucking workshops and taking free online courses to put on a resume to get nowhere with it, the humiliation of it all - I'm finished. This is my *entire life*, the main consumer of my physical, emotional and intellectual energy. There's nothing left over, and honestly, I feel so bad about myself - have since college, and this experience, not to mention the recursive *punishments* that come with working in shit jobs and for shit companies, in a city full of 21 year olds that have English majors and score internships for Google, Goldman Sachs, white shoe law firms like it's nothing...passive suicidal ideation is the only certainty that I've held onto into adulthood. 


I fantasize about being the women I went to school with - they're ""managers"" or software engineers after they got to major in art history, and now they're senior marketing majors pulling $100k+. They have full lives. 

They've not sweating bullets and crying because being employed in truly horrible jobs is all they have going for them after a layoff that seems like a life-defining layoff, looking at an economy like this.


If the arena of your life that consumes your whole person is employment, and you've never worked in a good job, with a good salary, where you're treated with respect and can get comofortable - it makes you sick. 

I had a pretty bad job I was laid off from before this one, but I think that was as close as I was going to get. I was as close to happy as I could hope to be in my last long-term temp assignment before that job and before some horrible health decision, but of course, that ended. I was happy in the first of five years in my long-term job. 


They both paid shit, were uncertain, and were unimportant. They had no future, no promotional track built in. 

And now I can reflect on losing those things and not being like other people, enough to hold onto something as piddling and pathetic as a not-terrible job.",t2_gydgrapt9,False,0,False,"Are you paranoid after the trauma of a bad job, bad luck, underemployment, etc?","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Companies'}]",r/jobs,False,6,,0,119.61538461538461,False,t3_18o14vg,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},140.0,,False,[],,False,False,{},Companies,False,7,False,False,self,1703208325.0,[],{},True,1703202926.0,richtext,6,text,self.jobs,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;sorry for length, spooling vent below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was laid off in August and I&amp;#39;m a few weeks into a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; job with a massive paycut for the &amp;quot;training period&amp;quot; - I have my &amp;quot;touchbase&amp;quot; with HR in January. It&amp;#39;s remote. I&amp;#39;m dreading it. I&amp;#39;ve grown to hate HR people - the middleman that will give me bad news, that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m imagining. No offense to HR people of this sub, but from this, HR generally seems to exist to immiserate employees and enable the company in disposing of them and making them unhappy, in addition to justifying its existence by sourcing candidates, giving desperate people like me false hope, and then dismissing them in the candidate search. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I had to do tasks for end-of-month alone and just...my manager goes on vacation tomorrow, it&amp;#39;s right before Christmas...he didn&amp;#39;t even zoom call me today. I worked without feedback the whole fuckin&amp;#39; day, for a very important task. I painstakingly went through it and every time I asked questions he just seemed frustrated. I know he had other stuff to do, &lt;em&gt;but if you&amp;#39;re going to fire for fucking something up&lt;/em&gt;, I could benefit from clear direction. Even before a holiday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel &lt;em&gt;unbearably&lt;/em&gt; paranoid after being laid off and exposed to an otherwise very nice person&amp;#39;s grouchy side by end of day. It&amp;#39;s been six weeks and he&amp;#39;s clearly frustrated, even if a task is new. There&amp;#39;s no way to talk about it either. It&amp;#39;s like telling a great white shark you&amp;#39;re afraid they&amp;#39;re going to eat you - planting the idea by stating the obvious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to say it - companies seem more adversarial than ever to their employees. I guess I&amp;#39;m used to it, but not quite like this, this continuously. Every time I start a new job, it really does seem worse. Something changed with lockdown too. I see the posts from people that talk about starting new jobs after a devastating layoff months before, only to be fired again; and there&amp;#39;s no way to assess it, especially if you&amp;#39;re the sort of person managers just don&amp;#39;t value or like. &lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"I never thought I would be in a situation where I needed to contemplate how to address a grown man's farting issues in a public workplace. I want to preface this entire thing with: my coworker just told me that this guy recently mentioned he is slightly autistic. I don't know if this has anything to do with the issue or not.
 
This guy joined our team about a year ago. He is probably about 35-40 yrs old. At first he seemed normal enough. A few months into joining the group, I slowly started having more and more issues with him. He's constantly burping under his breath all the time. His sneezes are the loudest sneezes I've ever heard come from a human, but what makes it bad is he always sneezes directly into his hand or sometimes just into the air (we work in a microbiology lab, so this is especially not good). In general he looks kind of unhygienic and grimy. He's the most socially unaware person I've ever met. But my biggest problem with him by far is his farting.

The first time or two I heard him fart, I thought not much of it because everyone has slip ups. But it kept happening. His cubicle is directly behind my cubicle, so I hear everything. Sorry for the detail but I think it's necessary:  It went from hearing quiet little farts once every few weeks, to hearing them every single day. The loudness and intention of the farts are also increasing. They used to be so quiet and almost seemed like they were slipping out/maybe an accident. But at this point they are getting pretty loud, and it's clear they are intentional. I hear him push them out and they are no accident. 

What is driving me nuts is since I am the one who sits closest to his cube, I hear the most out of everyone by far, so I feel like I am going crazy. My coworker has told me that she has heard him fart like once, but again she sits further away from him. He'll do quiet ones all the time when the cube area is full of people, and I think I'm the only one who hears it because of my proximity. But conveniently when it's just me or maybe one or two other people, he farts loudly. Not sure if this is a coincidence or not, but it almost feels like he is becoming more and more comfortable doing it around me or something? One time there was a small meeting with my manager (me, him, the manager, and 1 other person). My manager was talking and he farted over her. There was an awkward silence, no one said anything, and then everyone pretended it never happened. A few weeks later, I was walking directly behind him in the hallway and he let out a big fart.  I was fucking pissed. I think everyone is coming to the realization he is kind of a gross person, but they don't realize the extent of it because they don't sit right next to him. I don't know if I should confront him, wait for someone else to get fed up so they will say something instead, or maybe just get over it?? I'm a passive person and confronting someone is way out of my comfort zone.

There is only one empty cube that would be available for me to move to, but it's directly in front of where I am sitting now.

jobs,"Hi all. End of year reviews are coming up (yayyyy :/ ) and I am dreading them. I’ve worked at my company for 1.5+ years and have gotten nothing but stellar reviews from my boss. During my mid year review she commented on my career growth and we both agreed that the title of Quality Analyst would be a great role for me when I am ready to promote. I received a raise between my mid year and now, and during that process she let me know I could expect a company wide raise and that if all went well potentially a promotion. I’m unfortunately second guessing myself now and all our conversations as I feel that I need to advocate for my promotion in our EOY review.  This is my first full time job, so I really don’t have much experience in the corporate world. A lot of sites I’ve been doing research on state that there should be clear steps from my boss on how to get a promotion but this wasn’t outlined by her.

End of year reviews are coming up (yayyyy :/ ) and I am dreading them. I’ve worked at my company for 1.5+ years and have gotten nothing but stellar reviews from my boss. During my mid year review she commented on my career growth and we both agreed that the title of Quality Analyst would be a great role for me when I am ready to promote. I received a raise between my mid year and now, and during that process she let me know I could expect a company wide raise and that if all went well potentially a promotion. I’m unfortunately second guessing myself now and all our conversations as I feel that I need to advocate for my promotion in our EOY review.  This is my first full time job, so I really don’t have much experience in the corporate world. A lot of sites I’ve been doing research on state that there should be clear steps from my boss on how to get a promotion but this wasn’t outlined by her.

jobs,"For privacy reasons, I’d like to keep the company name and location private, but I’ll still note all actions I took. I would love advice and opinions. 

In late November, I applied for a role through the company’s website. I was contacted by a recruiter shortly after applying, and interviewed that same week. The first interview was with a consultant who explained the role in depth, and had some hard-hitting questions about my experience and qualifications. No “greatest strengths/weaknesses” type of questions. He seemed very knowledgeable in the field and was able to match my questions with educated answers. I was surprised that the first interview was so intense, but I was prepared, and it went well. No red flags from me here. He ends the interview saying he’ll forward me along the process and the next interview will be with HR. This interview was end of November. 

Now it’s a month later, and I finally get an interview with HR. The HR rep asks the basic questions (strength, weakness, reason for leaving, etc.). She also says they would prefer me for another role that pays $55-70k. The previous role offered $50-60k. We discussed this other role in some detail, but she’s HR so her knowledge of the day to day role requirements are limited. She explains they prefer me for this role that pays more, but is more challenging. I go along with it as I’m open to virtually any role that is applicable to my experience and field. 

That was Tuesday. Today, she calls and says they’d like to offer me the position and there will be an offer letter in my inbox by EOD. We discuss benefits briefly, and the call is short. 

Here are my red flags:
1. I was expecting another interview with an SME that would allow me to learn more about this specific role, but also to vet that my skills and experience translate into this role as it’s a completely different title than the one I initially applied for, though the concepts are transferable. 
2. This role requires 6 years of experience. I have 3, maybe 4 if you’re counting undergrad unpaid work. In this phone call, she said they’re offering me 70k (max of range). Realistically, I have only 2.25 years of applied knowledge that they would want, and my resume is very clear and transparent. 

Is this a scam? Top of the pay range after two interviews seems too good to be true. 

Some possible relevant details: I did zoom interviews with both the HR rep and the consultant. Both match their LinkedIn profiles and their profiles seem fully filled out and established. I haven’t been asked for any personal details. The job is in person and I’ve confirmed the location exists. 

I’ve been advised to call the company through a number online, but I’m not sure how to call and ask if the offer is legit in a professional manner. Also, I’m still waiting for the official offer by tonight, so I will edit/update if needed when that comes in.

&amp;#x200B;

The times I'm currently going through are the darkest I've ever experienced my whole life.

I decided to post about it for me to get perspective and much needed help/advice, and also for my post to be a reference to anyone else who may experience the same at some point for them to read something they relate to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a software engineer and after graduation I spent 2.5 years at a company, at first it was stressful and work was demanding and I've learned a lot but in the last 8 months things have been very chill and cushy due to the project I'm working on nearing it's end and there wasn't much to do, so I'd find myself with basically ""open holidays"" on remote days since I didn't have any tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've enjoyed that lifestyle a lot and sort of got really comfortable (and lazy) but at the same time it was much needed as I was in the process of recovering from a terrible anxiety attack that I've dealt with a year ago, I'd say I've recovered well from it but not entirely 100% and this is part of my dilemma.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 3 months ago I've decided to look for a more paying job to pursue or rather accelerate getting to some long term goals I have (more savings, working towards financial independence one day)

So I interviewed with a major consulting company (MBB) and got an offer with 53% raise, at first I was hesitant due to what I heard about the long hours and stressful working conditions but I decided to give it a go.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now 2 months in and the work is indeed very challenging and stressful and having anxiety really doesn't help, my life now is basically just work or recovering from work and drinking alcohol.

The regret and overthinking creeps in daily and it tortures my mental health which ironically hinders my performance. I keep worrying whether I won't be able to sustain this, or that my performance won't be enough and I'd be fired (although I've gotten good feedback on my skills and output) and I worry that I've messed up my life and I'm missing out on all the fun I used to have freely while working at my previous job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly lost now and my mental health is really messed up and sometimes I wonder if I've ruined my life by this decision, at the same time my mind tells me that despite having anxiety I shouldn't be getting used to comfort too much in order to not stagnate, after all there's no easy way to make money and reach my goals other than having decent skills and working hard and that I should just push through this.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 3 months ago I&amp;#39;ve decided to look for a more paying job to pursue or rather accelerate getting to some long term goals I have (more savings, working towards financial independence one day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I interviewed with a major consulting company (MBB) and got an offer with 53% raise, at first I was hesitant due to what I heard about the long hours and stressful working conditions but I decided to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now 2 months in and the work is indeed very challenging and stressful and having anxiety really doesn&amp;#39;t help, my life now is basically just work or recovering from work and drinking alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regret and overthinking creeps in daily and it tortures my mental health which ironically hinders my performance. I keep worrying whether I won&amp;#39;t be able to sustain this, or that my performance won&amp;#39;t be enough and I&amp;#39;d be fired (although I&amp;#39;ve gotten good feedback on my skills and output) and I worry that I&amp;#39;ve messed up my life and I&amp;#39;m missing out on all the fun I used to have freely while working at my previous job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m honestly lost now and my mental health is really messed up and sometimes I wonder if I&amp;#39;ve ruined my life by this decision, at the same time my mind tells me that despite having anxiety I shouldn&amp;#39;t be getting used to comfort too much in order to not stagnate, after all there&amp;#39;s no easy way to make money and reach my goals other than having decent skills and working hard and that I should just push through this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to get some advice and opinions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time!&lt;/p&gt;

Here we go!

**Q: Where are you located?**

A: I am based in Kent, Ashford in the UK.

**Q: What is your role title?**

A: My role title is Graphic Designer.

**Q: In your words, describe what you actually do?**

**Q: How long have you been doing this role for?**

A: I've been a graphic designer for a few years, since 2021.

**Q: How did you get to this point in your career?**

A: I studied graphic design in school and built up my skills and portfolio over time. I applied for junior roles at design agencies and worked my way up.

**Q: When it comes to remuneration, what are your three B’s? (Base, Bonus, Benefits?)**

A: For remuneration, my base salary is really good. It’s currently in £95k. I receive an annual bonus based on performance and that varies year on year. My benefits include health insurance, retirement contributions, and paid time off.

**Q: I’m not going to ask you who you work for, but, what industry is your company in?**

A: I work at a design agency that serves clients in various industries. We do graphic design work for marketing campaigns, branding, publications, events, and more.

**Q: When it comes to work flexibility, is your work primarily office-based, fully remote, or a mix of both? Which do you prefer? Does your company allow you to be flexible?**

A: My work is a mix of in office and remote. I go to the office for collaborative meetings and work sessions. But I also have flexibility to work from home when I need focused time. I like the combination.

**Q: What does an average week or a typical day look like for you? Can you walk me through your day? What time do you arrive and start at work, what are your main tasks/responsibilities, who do you interact with, what meetings do you attend, etc.?**

A: A typical day starts around 8:30 AM when I commute to the office. We have a morning meeting at 10:30 to align on priorities. Then I'll work on current design projects - maybe creating a logo or laying out a magazine ad. I collaborate with other designers and take feedback from clients. I take a lunch break around 1 PM. More heads-down design work in the afternoon. I try to leave by 6 PM if possible.

**Q: What does a typical day look like when things are going well vs a more challenging/stressful day?**

A: On good days, I'm in the flow creating new design work. On stressful days, there may be tight deadlines or challenges getting feedback and approvals from clients.

**Q: What skills or knowledge are most important for your day-to-day work?**

A: The most important skills are creative thinking, communication, and expertise in design software and tools.

**Q: What are some examples of recent accomplishments or contributions you've made in this role?**

A: Recent accomplishments were rebranding a client's visual identity and being promoted to senior designer.

**Q: Do you have a supportive manager and do you feel valued?**

A: My manager provides guidance but also gives me autonomy. I feel valued for my contributions.

**Q: How much time do you spend collaborating with colleagues vs working independently?**

A: It's a mix - I collaborate closely with my design team but also have independent work.

**Q: Is there anything you wish you would have known before starting this role?**

A: I wish I had known how much communication with clients would be part of the job.

**Q: What do you hate most about your role?**

A: The tight deadlines can be frustrating.

**Q: What do you love most about your role?**

A: I love the creative process of problem solving and designing appealing visuals.

**Q: What’s the next role for you and when do you hope to achieve this?**

A: In the next few years I hope to become an Art Director leading projects.

**Q: Is your next role going to be with the same company or a different one?**

A: I plan to progress within my current company for now.

**Q: What’s one piece of advice you could give to someone who aspires to reach your position?**

A: My advice is to develop your style and skills but also be open to feedback and collaboration. Communication is key.

**Q: It’s Day 1 for someone in your role. What one piece of advice would you give them to succeed?**

A: Don't be afraid to ask questions! Whether it's clarifying a project brief, getting feedback on a design, or asking colleagues for help with a technical issue - don't assume you can or should figure it all out on your own.

The people you work with have valuable insights and experience to share. Asking questions shows you want to do your best work and continue growing. Admitting what you don't know yet is a strength, not a weakness.

The other key is believing in your own creative vision and skills. Trust your instincts and design ability, while also taking constructive criticism and mentorship from others. Finding the right balance of conviction in your own ideas and openness to feedback will help you create great work and thrive in your role over time.

jobs,"Started over a year ago at this company as a junior DS due to lack of domain expertise. 

Being a fast learner and understanding business needs better than people in my team I became the go to person for almost everything. I get asked for advice/help internally and externally. 

6 months ago we got another junior with on paper good credentials and many years of experience, but even after 6 months they need to be explained every problem step by step. Multiple times as well since they can’t connect the dots if one variable is different. I guess that’s normal for a junior? Shouldn’t be in this case though but they somehow bullshitted their way into this and I’ve to deal with their mistakes. That just made me realize the discrepancies between us ‚juniors‘. 

Now I’m wondering if I’m shooting myself in the foot? Eventho I’m doing the same work as the seniors and being the inofficial team lead I’m getting junior salary. How can I make my case for a promotion when I wouldn’t be able to add new responsibilities since I’m already doing everything on a senior level.

jobs,"I currently work in a place where I was hired not long after I graduated from college. It is a GREAT place to work for: good insurance benefits; five weeks or more PTO (depending on how long you’ve been there); good pay; beautiful offices; and I have never dealt with office politics, drama, or harassment.

I started in this place of work during a recession, which meant there were a whole lot of us graduating from college and there were more of us looking for jobs than there were jobs to be had, which means that I started at a very low salary. This reflected on my paychecks (despite raises of 3-4% every year) until I was offered a new position in another firm in 2019. At that time, my current place of work gave me a sizeable raise and a new position. I was given another raise and new position in 2021. In February of this year, I interviewed and was offered a different position at another location, which would have been a 20% raise. My current place of employment could not offer me a better position, but they did offer me a 25% raise to stay, and so… I stayed. 

Now, I have recently interviewed for a new position in a new company, which is offering a 23% raise over what I am currently making. I know that my current employer cannot match that, and I’m not sure that they would, given that they just gave me a raise earlier this year to keep me. 

So, I’m stuck. This new position is 100% remote and that sort of money is not something I can downplay. And I know that part of me was looking for something new, because why else would I have responded to the recruiter who reached out to me? However, at the same time, I love where I currently work and those whom I work with. I keep thinking if I hold on there a little longer, there may be a management position for me in the future, or at the very least a new host of responsibilities that build upon the skills I’ve honed throughout my years there. At the same time, my boss has already told me that they won’t be creating any new jobs in 2024 due to the chaotic nature of election years and the uncertainty of the economy. Without the creation of new roles, there is no hope for me to move up, as all the positions I’ve held thus far are those that were created for me; what I do did not exist before I was hired. 

Any and all advice welcome. I’d love to hear input from others who have been in this position and what decision you made, and whether you think it was a good one.

Fucking grocery stores won’t return my applications.  The only people who did respond is Red Robin and even then I can’t guarantee I’ll have a job with them because I don’t have serving experience.  How the hell am I a) supposed to get experience when everyone refuses to hire and b) find an open position when no one actually indicates whether the positions are filled or not.  Why do they scream no one wants to work when in reality they won’t let anyone work.  I need a fucking job, and no one will give me one.  How is it right you need a job to live, but there suddenly is no jobs for you?  Fuck corporations and this dystopian society.  Right to work my ass.  I even agreed to the fucking arbitration agreements which is a condition of employment and also would prevent unionizing (which I thought corps couldn’t outwardly blockade whether they wanted to or not but whatever, this is the United States companies have more rights than people do).

So when my boss enquired, he was told a flat no.  I then heard a couple days later that a colleague (mentioned earlier and in similar role but with more in person need) has been allowed to WFH in Africa for months to visit family...

&lt;p&gt;All that context to say, I know I’m an excellent people and functional manager, and I know I can win over people when they have time after the interview, but I’m a very easy book to judge by its cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What advice do you all have either placing yourself in my shoes or the team’s shoes to show up and position for this interview?&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"I worked at a grocery store for 5 years before getting an internship at a small business to do their marketing (which is what i was in school for)

After my internship i got a full time marketing job at this company and I've been loving it. My grocery store job has been a small 1 shift per weekend gig just to stay as an employee there in case things went south.

Late September an opportunity came up for the grocery store so i applied for the promotion and was given an offer, which was about a 20% raise from the marketing job but i decided to reject it to stay in a career path for marketing.

This is all information that the small business owner knew. And after knowing all of this, he went out of his way to hire a more expensive out sourced agency to replace me and is letting me go in the new year for ""not having enough money to pay everyone"".

jobs,"**Q: Does anyone have suggestions on a format for a receipt that I can generate and bring to have the receptionist sign-off that they took back the equipment from me?**

I don't want to find out in another week or two after the holidays that they claim I never gave anything back, and are withholding payment.  If they *do* withhold payment, I'll have a case for the DOL, that's for certain.  

My now former employer wants me to return company-issued equipment or they will illegally withhold pay.  (Company is based in Missouri, **not** South Dakota) I have already skimmed the FLSA and I understand that this is a violation.  I can file a complaint, but Missouri has stated that they don't take action until after 16 days.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to find out in another week or two after the holidays that they claim I never gave anything back, and are withholding payment.  If they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; withhold payment, I&amp;#39;ll have a case for the DOL, that&amp;#39;s for certain.  &lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"Hello, I (26M) am looking for recommendations and advice on where to go from my current job situation.

I  am currently working in a firearm store in California for almost a year  and a half. I want to move on from it because it's a high-stress,  minimum wage job that requires lots of knowledge on firearm laws. I love  the job and my coworkers, but I feel the skills I built up from the job  can be applied somewhere that's more challenging, more impactful in the  community, and with better pay.

I'm  looking for suggestions where to go from here if there's any other job  that rhymes or is parallel with the job skills I'm using now. My  education background is a BFA creative degree, but after getting the job  after the pandemic I've been exposed to a lot more law enforcement  figures that's making me rethink my future career paths and personal  goal. The general idea of skills we use in the store are these skills:

\- Learning and expressing federal and state firearm laws affecting the everyday California resident.

\-  Review, cross-reference, and collect information regarding given legal  documents such as IDs, birth certificates, peace officer/military/fed  credentials, FSC cards, naturalization papers, name change/marriage  docs, green cards, work/student visas, etc.

\-  Inspect, build, and demonstrate safe firearm handling while recording  required information of the make, model, serial number, type of firearm,  caliber, and barrel length

\- Adhered to Federal and CA firearm laws on selling and delivering firearms to civilians, peace officers,

\-  Double-check with compliance officer and manager for situations such as  refund/exchange inspections, status on delivery of firearms and other  items, and second opinions on customer-provided paperwork to start  background check/deliver firearm to them if it's sufficient or not

\- Calmed down disgruntled and possible firearm-ineligible customers with pose and courtesy

\- Lifted and transported firearms and other gear weighing up to 40 lbs

Also  want to add that I have a COE (Certificate of Eligibility;  California-specific requirement to work in a firearm-related business)  that required passing a Live Scan so I have a clean record with no  criminal history.

I'm currently  looking to dip my toe in a possible law enforcement career, specifically  in the non-sworn capacity for now. I'm looking forward to take classes  at a community college in the Administration of Justice program to learn  about investigation methods, police writing, and fingerprint classes. I  am slightly hesitant if I'm going in a path that ends up nowhere though  since I'm not from a background where my family worked for law  enforcement of any kind and it's not like I originally studied subjects  that would be preferred for it, so I feel I'm being too late to change  career paths.

jobs," Just finished my interview just now at 3pm . It left me in tears

There are 2 interviewers. One of them asked me some questions and I think I answer them perfectly , as perfect as I can be. It wasn't until the other one pipe in . He said I only have 1 year in XXX technology and I have no experience in this and that . He asked me whats my confidence level and how fast I think I can pick up. I said give me one month . Then he went on to ask me some question that I don't know the answer to , then proceed to say he doesn't think I can handle it in a month.

He also say stuff like don't expect the senior to pull the red carpet for you because they always have their own things to do. And that if I get to the company , I am basically a junior .

I am sick of this world where I always have to prove myself and get my confidence trashed in the process. Its demotivating. Its like the past 5 years I work are for nothing . Now I am back to being a fresh grad. This is the consequences where I didn't leave my old job . I don't regret leaving my old job because I believe this is what I needed to do.

I just wish it isn't so freaking hard. I have worked for 5 freaking years .Does that not count for anything ? I am tired

jobs,"Hi there!

I come to you with a question/curiosity:
What are the job opportunities in data analysis/data science for Danish/Swedish/Norwegian non-speakers?

Context:
In the last two years I visited Denmark (quite a few places: Vejle, Kolding, Esbjerg, Billund, Odense, Copenhagen, Varde, Fredericia, Aarhus - I haven't visited the northern part yet as you can see) and the experiences were very pleasant for me (next year I plan to visit Sweden and Norway).
From the staff at the airport, supermarkets or trains, I had nothing but pleasant experiences - I know I may be influenced by the ""tourist experience"". I loved the vibe of the place - being from Romania, where the collective traits are: more extroverted, more expansive people - exactly what I am not and the north might be a place for me.

Currently, I have been working for two and a half years as a data analyst, being a statistics graduate and on my way to finish my masters degree in data science.
Moreover, for about half a year I started studying Norwegian, Swedish and Danish on Duolingo (I know, it's not much) and I would like to try to apply for jobs in the field of data in the next year/two years.

I mention that I don't necessarily want to live in a specific city. I would be willing to work remotely before physically moving to Norway/Sweden/Denmark, until I can finish my studies.

jobs,"I got to the final stage Assessment Centre of a graduate scheme in the UK and got rejected.

I applied last year and got through to the same stage that I did this year. Both years different aspects of the assessment centre were my downfall ie. Last year it was my case study but I did really well in my HR interview. This year, I did really well in my case study and average in my HR interview. 

I got feedback and out of 6 questions, I answered 4 very well and 2 average/just above average. 

To be honest, I wasn’t too fazed by the rejection initially as I knew it meant I could reapply and it’s just redirection.

Now, after getting my feedback and hearing I was so close to getting it is definitely a eye opener for me - I’m so glad I improved especially because I really struggled with the case study last year but I guess I should have focused my prep more on the HR aspect too. 

I guess in the moment rn it feels worse to know I was SO close but just trying to remind myself that I’ve been improving every year and that’s all that matters.

Last year it was my case study but I did really well in my HR interview. This year, I did really well in my case study and average in my HR interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got feedback and out of 6 questions, I answered 4 very well and 2 average/just above average. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I wasn’t too fazed by the rejection initially as I knew it meant I could reapply and it’s just redirection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, after getting my feedback and hearing I was so close to getting it is definitely a eye opener for me - I’m so glad I improved especially because I really struggled with the case study last year but I guess I should have focused my prep more on the HR aspect too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess in the moment rn it feels worse to know I was SO close but just trying to remind myself that I’ve been improving every year and that’s all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else been in the same situation? I guess I’ve never been aware that I was so close to getting a job but i I would have rather have had the feedback than be oblivious as to how to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"Hello, just looking for some quick advice on a non-critical job question.

So I moved to a romantic mountain town after meeting a guy who is taking over a bike shop offered me a job. I'm a bike mechanic by hobby and have a technical background so it seemed like a no brainer.

I've since moved in and have been hanging out working in the shop here and there, not yet paid as he hasn't gotten ownership yet. So basically I've been fixing a bike or two for free for him, under the guise of ""training"" (stupid on my part professionally, I know, but small town vibes).

We talked pay and he offered me $18 to start, to go up to $20. This is pennies and I don't know how to tell him I need to start at $20 without ruffling his feathers. I kind of moved here with the expectation that I'd be one of the key members of his shop (although I can find another job if I need to, I'd just rather work for him). But I can't really stand up to the expectations for... $18/hr. 

Anyone have good advice for convincing him to start me at $20? He's technologically incompetent and I can help out there. And I'm a pretty good mechanic all-in-all. He wants me to be as excited for the shop as he is, but for $18 I'm not too sure I can really muster any joy. $20 barely covers living expenses, will still need a side gig. 

Side note, I have about 2 weeks until I'm on payroll so I'm wondering if it's better to ask now or wait until things are closer and I have more time to ""prove"" myself?

jobs,"I have been formally warned my job is at risk for having terrible odors!

(If you click on my user name on the Reddit page you will see that I have lots of crazy- but true- stories about a boss that wants me gone.)

I need to hold out 9 more months with the company to get my pension!  If I leave before then my pension will be cut by 50% or more.

In his latest effort to get rid of me, the boss has pulled me into his office and showed me an official written warning about my bad body odor and bad breath.  He tells me that a number of employees have come to him and complained and said it is nearly impossible to be in the same room as me.  The Facility Human Resources Director was also in the meeting and started to lecture me about personal hygiene.

I told both of them that my personal hygiene, appearance and health is very important to me.  I shower ever day, use high quality soap and deodorant, brush my teeth four times a day  (YES!) and use mouth wash.  I wash my clothes with high quality laundry detergent in a new washer/dryer and don't wear my clothes more than once between washings. They just rolled their eyes and said they don't believe me.

I asked friends and family in and out of the office if I had body odor and bad breath and they said absolutely not.

My lawyer says we need to demand a formal workforce investigation where an outside neutral party would interview staff to see if there is any truth to my bad breath and body odor.

jobs,"Hello r/jobs.

I am in a conundrum, like a few months ago, the job market was quite mean to me, I was left out to dry for 3 months (I know it's not long, but eh). I am from Europe, by the way. I will be quite vague about the jobs, because I don't want to have issues down the line.

Now though, I get two amazing offers, for two different (well, slightly different) careers. This is only my second job, I didn't work for like a year and a half for personal reasons after staying at a single company for about 6 years.

Anyway, the idea is that I was quite frantic, I sent my CVs everywhere, just to pick up anything, I got some very shitty interviews and some very shitty initial offers (lower than my first job), but then my luck suddenly changed and I suddenly suffer of success.

Now I find myself having to reject people, and I find it very difficult considering the circumstances:

**Company 1 (something like a tech supp for an in-app - Hybrid job, day only, monday to friday):**

\+ Will accomodate me getting a higher education (never even thought about it, they mentioned it), I'll also get a bump to my salary if I do finish a higher education.

\+ Has lots of extra bonuses that do matter, the obvious ones being meal tickets (both have this), but some extras too.

\+ The pay is higher, they're actually the reason the other company plussed to the point of being at only 10% difference in pay.

\+ Will in time learn a lot of programming languages for this job.

\+ They know about my (low) skills, yet they're confident in training me.

\+ I fucked up something along the way in what I told them, but they accomodated me there as well.

\+ Very intense one man army tech support (not a bad thing for me)

\+ Big company, good for CV.

\+/- The people are ok, extremely serious though, I think it might be related to their in-company rules since this is a big company?

\- The basis of the job is still the same like my first one, it's just remote support.

**Company 2 (local tech support - Office only, day only, monday to friday):**

\+They plussed when I told them the other offer (after some ""deliberations"")

\+ Will learn more about servers, networks, and is more hardware oriented (unlike my first and Company 1's job)

\+ Will have an office to support all to myself (later on) in terms of organizing it, until they eventually bring in other people (it's a plus because that's cool, I like challenges).

\+ The people seem very cool, my colleagues in the other tech departments are very savvy and look like people I will make good friends with.

\+ They also know I am new to dealing with hardware business wise, yet they're willing to go far to take me.

\+ I get to know the whole office because of the nature of the job.

(Extra +) It's 95% women because of the nature of the company. Hot too, hahaha.

\+/- Smaller company, maybe good for culture and ehhhh for CV

\+/- Their initial pay was low, they only plussed because of the other offer

\- 10% lower pay

\---

I really don't know what to do, and I talked to family, friends, it's basically a tie. Do I go for more money and benefits? I no longer care about Hybrid/Remote/Office either. Do I continue on with a mostly software related career or do I go for hardware? Company 1's position is actually higher level. Should pay matter that much if I get to talk to the whole office as someone that has a harder time interacting with new people (so I get the opportunity for free)? Both are great offers where I live, I'd basically live like a king.

Despite both companies having their own interests, I still believe in treating the people I talked to, well, like people.

I was hired as a contract to renew a year and a half ago at a company that had been acquired by a much larger company. This subsidiary was going on a typical COVID era hiring spree, and the role I had was relatively safe-ish because I am a senior developer for their mobile platform.

Yesterday I learned our parent company is about to be acquired by an even larger company.

Will the usual rules of the parent company taking the axe to headcount automatically apply if what my subsidiary does isn't redundant? Or are there other things to look at when trying to make guesses about what comes next?

Because of the work flow, sometimes even when on a project, there's no work.  I will say I have worked consistently for almost 9 years now.  I am paid by the hour.

Last year our company was bought out leaving me only terrible ($9,000 deductible &amp; more than 9% of my income) insurance.  I am in late 50s and need better insurance because of medical issues. I lost all my other benefits: short term and long term disability, HSA, and life insurance.  

I do get paid for 6 holidays a year.  I do have a 401k that they match. It's work from home and super flexible.  I can work any hours from 7am to 7pm.  If I  want a vacation I just put it on the calendar and take it.  No approval needed. I can take time off for appointments anytime, just calendar it. I've been offered a higher position but it only pays about 9% more and I would be required to work 40 hours and be under a tremendous amount of stress which I don't think is worth it.  In that position you have far more work than you can do with no overtime pay. You have to deal with all the bullshit that comes with a higher position so I feel it's not worth it.

I see no raise in my future at all.  I can't continue to live on my current payment until retirement.  The cost of living is just increasing too much. In my city they say you need to make $90k a year just to survive.  Even at 40 hours, I would only be making about $55k. I have practically no retirement saved.

It's a pretty good environment as far as not being toxic.  I do my job each day and pretty much I am left alone.

jobs,"Gonna keep this short.

I work at the front desk of a small residential building. Less than 10 employees including maintenance.

I mention the workforce size because I'm under the impression it's the reason for the issue I'm having.

Since I've been here (about 6 months) I can count on one hand- how many times I was given a break. The building's ""Employee Handbook"" states that any employee that works 8 hours *MUST* take a 30 minute break. 

Recently, at a meeting, I brought this issue up to the buildings Superintendent, Manager, Board President + Board Treasurer- when they told us they no longer want us eating at the front desk.

I simply asked ""if we don't get relief for a break, where are we supposed to eat our lunch?"" 

Their agreed upon response was to ""eat in the package room.""

Sorry for the long post, i needed to vent

i'm 21 and work as an admin at an engineering company in UK and although my job can be done completely remotely without ANY downside, i am forced to work alternating shifts of 6am till 2pm and 2pm till 11pm changing on a weekly basis.

I absolutely hate the late shifts as my whole week goes to complete waste but the biggest reason is that my girlfriend suffers with depression and on those weeks i can't even be there for her. Its so painful being at work getting told that your SO just hurt her self and you couldn't be there to help cause its 10pm and you're STILL AT WORK AS AN OFFICE PERSON????

What i want to do is, after the christmas break ask my boss if i could come in on the morning shifts but work from home on the afternoon shifts (so 2 weeks out of the month from home) and if not then im going to quit which would suck as the job itself is fine and pays very well for my age but i just cant stand this anymore. its effecting me mentally.

**Is that a sensible proposition based on the above?**

Through asking other people, this company is not keen on allowing working from home and i will never understand WHY is there so many places that for some reason are against it, If a job can be done remotely why are you stopping your employees from that option??? Such backwards thinking.

Note: i can't ask to change from shifts to a regular 9-5 schedule as since its shift work, when i go home another person swaps with me and only one admin for my department is needed per shift.

I have been mostly cooking in the kitchen and never liked it. I usually put in my two weeks but there has been times when I had to leave on the spot. Recently I left my job as a server due to stress and physically getting sick every day. I didn't have anything lined up and started to try looking/applying after I quit. I found it was difficult to find a job online, get my foot in for an interview, get passed an interview, and even went back to applying for cook positions I know I don't like. There was one chef in the past I used to work for. I left without notice, no call, no show, I just didn't know how to say I don't want to work here. Later in life I even went back to see if he would hire me back and felt he would because I work hard and get along well with others. He said ""love to have you back but you wanted out before sure you want back now?"" It meant a lot to me and I didn't take the job. Now being without work for a few months and interviews not following up with me I wanted to put down some references and wanted to give that chef a call to ask if I could put him down. He said ""yeah of cores you can put me down for a reference, and if you need a job I would love to hire a guy like you"" with was a bit different from our last conversation about me cooking.

Its a supper nice resort all renovated but the kitchen is 60 years outdated. He said it was chill and slow, the place was burning down but there on the up. He also said no overtime and two days off in a row with was verry important to me, I dont want the overtime especially in a kitchen. I was a little concerned by what some things i heard nut took the job and in three weeks I started as a line cook. He said line no banquets. Things just start getting bad from the begging. He brings me and three other chefs in for a meeting and says he is getting rid of the temp banquet chefs. Then he tells us it's gonna be a small crew now and step it up because he is. ""The schedules are gonna be weird and there is going to be overtime. Also you are gonna need to help with banquets when you can"". The soldier in me iv been trained to be my whole life says ""yes cheff"" and my back says ""no dude"". It's my third day and I ask when im going to have a day off. ""Your gonna have to do a seven day stretch"" he says, im just like ""oooook"". Then the schedule comes out and it's 8 days in a row. After that night I wake up sick, go into work and mention it and they just say ""yeah it's going around"" I also realy start noticing the poor equipment is hurting me.

jobs,"So I was suppose to have a meeting with getting me a job. Yes My job counselor is a female government worker. Allot of stuff happened yesterday and I have PTSD and panic attacks. I don't know what I should do. During our meeting I was verbally attacked and instead of going forward with finding me work. She got defensive and brought up a bunch of drama over silly stuff in emails and such with the job coach etc. It felt more like an interrogation than a meeting tbh. I have a disability and she set off my PTSD because I'm scared of women like her who uses manipulation tactics etc. She ruined me yesterday. Caused me to have severe depression etc. Job coach is in the wrong too.

jobs,"My background: I graduated in STEM from a well-known North American university and currently living on the West Coast. Upon graduation, I immediately started a SaaS start-up with a close friend. I serve as the CTO and my friend CEO. I self-learnt web development and developed the product all by myself for a few years before we raised enough money to hire more employees. Gradually, I transitioned towards a leadership role rather than coding. I'd be responsible for hiring senior devs and managers, participating in high-level product decisions, and generally help everyone solve problems in coding, UX/UI, delivery processes. I am still coding once in a while, but I don't have enough time to get really deep into anything new. After a little more than a decade, we grew it to a sizeable company of around 50 people and recently sold it to a large investment firm.

The parent firm already signalled that they wanted us gone ASAP so they could install their own management. I also think it's a good time for me to move on to a new venture anyway. But I'm having a hard time deciding what to do next. My whole adult life has always been with my start-up and I don't think I've ever applied for any full-time job before, besides a few internships in college. I will list a few thoughts here hoping someone could help me process them.

\- My earn-out from the sale was decent and enough to sustain myself for quite awhile, but it's nowhere near enough to live comfortably while being unemployed.

\- My friend already wanted to jump on a new start-up with me. But tbh, the ideas of sleepless nights and financial uncertainties don't appeal to me as much now as in my 20s. In the case I do start a new start-up, I want to invest my own money this time instead of raising VC money. So I need to conserve my fund.

\- I can apply for a smaller role in another firm, maybe a senior software dev? This allows me less stress responsibility-wise while still having a decent pay so I don't have to eat into my fund. It also gives me time to develop myself technically and find ideas for my next startup. But does it look bad that a CTO's next job is going backward to a dev role?

\- I can also do a lateral move to a management role in another firm. Maybe a VP or Director of Engineering? This will obviously make the job-search process more rigorous and the job itself will be quite stressful again. But the pay will be much better and it will look better on my resume.

\- I can also go back to school? Maybe a Master in AI or ML. I never had a chance to study properly in university because of money. I had to take random courses to work and graduated very early. Also going back to school is a good excuse to have some gap years in my resume while starting a new start-up.

\- I've always been a more product-focused CTO rather than a technical one. I've always considered coding a tool to solve problems, and learned them as I needed. I think I lack deep understanding of many programming disciplines such as languages, best practices, Dev Op, etc... I only knew what to use to solve what problems come my way.

jobs,"Is there a future and jobs that aren’t hellish?

I don’t know what I’m going to do

I am a college student right now 19 years old about to turn 20. I have autism and have experience with working with wildlife to pets and even fish. I went to a career tech school during my junior and senior year for veterinary assisting. It made me realize I don’t want to work with pets because I’d get way too frustrated with people due to them neglecting to take care of their animals and leaving things out that could’ve killed their pet. I’ve never had a job in my life because I’ve heard nothing but awful things from my friends about what they had to go through. I am trying to get a degree in biology in order to potentially become a field biologist, zoologist or zoo veterinary(I’m not entirely sure). But everytime I think about how I’m going to be working until I’m going to die makes me feel life is pointless. I don’t want to deal with people ordering me around with no respect for me. I don’t want to deal with customers and bosses who treat me like dirt and don’t care. I wouldn’t take that and likely shut down. I hate the idea of 8-10 hours shifts it makes me want to die. I have a hard time staying awake even for seven hours due to narcolepsy. There are some days when I need at least one nap during the day. It is better at night for some reason as I can stay awake longer. I just don’t know what to do with my life and don’t want to live in hell for the rest of it. One of the career presenters we had in the college class told us we would spend most of our waking hours at work. That is what started this entire crisis. I hate it and it is why one day I hope to start my own business. I want to change things even if it is on a small scale. I don’t think people should be worked as many hours as they are. What am I supposed to do with my life in terms of jobs? I feel like this life isn’t for me and it hurts. I want to become a pet sitter over the summer. I did try to get a job as a kennel assistant in highschool things looked great and I even shadowed but then they never got backs I me after. I’ve had issues with people in the past disrespecting me and certain things trigger me. I am sensitive to sounds. 

TLDR: Midlife crisis about realizing how miserable working is and how powerless I feel in the scheme of it. Long hours are scary because I’m unsure if I can endure them due to narcolepsy. I feel hopeless in the job industry because I feel like I’m going to fail. I feel there is no hope for me to be happy and have time to myself. I just feel stuck.

jobs,"I've been at my job for a year now, and up to this point, I've gotten a raise every year in the last 15, with every company I've worked for. This will be the first year I don't see one.

Last year I was promoted to management at my last job with a significant raise, but after several months I didn't feel like I was quite ready because I realized there was a lot I didn't know. I made a move to a new company for a lesser position but with the same salary.

This company I'm with now is deep in the hole. I don't know exactly how severe it is, but everything is about saving money right now and tracking every single dollar. They have cut a lot of hourly positions, but so far it seems the salary side is unaffected.

&lt;p&gt;Last year I was promoted to management at my last job with a significant raise, but after several months I didn&amp;#39;t feel like I was quite ready because I realized there was a lot I didn&amp;#39;t know. I made a move to a new company for a lesser position but with the same salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This company I&amp;#39;m with now is deep in the hole. I don&amp;#39;t know exactly how severe it is, but everything is about saving money right now and tracking every single dollar. They have cut a lot of hourly positions, but so far it seems the salary side is unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"Hey All!

&amp;#x200B;

Long time lurker, first time posting in this subreddit. I wanted to share my latest experience with my career, anonymously. This is more of me getting this off of my chest and less seeking any advice or answers. It is a bit of a long read and is 100% based on what I went through the later part of this year. Read on at your discretion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will start by saying I love my job, coworkers, clients &amp; even my bosses. It feels more like a hobby and I honestly can't wait to start my working days. I'm also enthusiastically working towards partner. That being said, I recognize that I'm working to provide a good life for my family first. Period. My firm went through a recent merger, significantly increasing in size (think mid-size firm, to large firm). In October, I spoke with the lead partner of the legacy firm on my raise (goes into effect 1/1/2024) and bonus for 2023. Bonus was in line with previous years so all OK there. Raise was not in line with previous years. You'll never guess which direction the raise went (If you guessed down, you were right). 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to negotiate for a better raise and was politely shut down. I was told the new firm would be able to afford a bigger annual raise for everyone moving forward and this was the best they could offer. I was frustrated. I had planned to bat for myself this year and had a specific $ amount in mind. With the weirdness surrounding the recent merger, my planned negotiation went sideways. I projected my salary with raises forward and found it would take two more years to get what I was asking for. Other coworkers were just as disappointed as I was. One good thing to note, the rest of the benefit package (namely insurance), was a LOT better than the previous firm. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were told they would pay out our PTO balance. The firm was not required to by law so it was nice to hear we would get something (although we do have some full remote employees who live in states that protect their employees from employers not wanting to pay out their benefits package. In this case, they were entitled to EVERY hour they had accrued). Then the PTO email goes out to each of us. After discussing with coworkers, we quickly found that ""policy"" would not allow ALL hours to be paid out. Our feelings of disappointed frustration escalated to livid ire. 

&amp;#x200B;

Partners had conversations with each of us to discuss our thoughts on the PTO payout and policy. A lot of coworkers were open and honest with them on how they felt. I was too. Overall tone was the employees were responsible too and had to be accountable to some degree for not using all their PTO (which is difficult to say the least, we have a lot of demanding projects and clients). I made a point to the partner I spoke with that it was unfair that not everyone would get what they earned. Since some people lived in a state that protected their rights, they would be getting paid for *all* their PTO, while the majority of us would *not*. The partner did not have a lot to say to that.

&amp;#x200B;

About this time, something in me snapped. I will go on record and say I'm dog loyal to a fault. Church and family first, but job close behind in third place (I just realized as I was typing this that I never even thought to add myself to my own list of loyalties. Wow..). I began applying for other jobs. I felt conflicted, like I was angry at my current job, so I guiltily cheated on them by looking for something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, due to employee backlash of the PTO payout, the firm decided to pay out every hour. Honestly, this would have been a better move from the start, but it did go a long way to see the firm was trying to do right by the employees and give them what they were owed. It even kept some coworkers from seeking other job opportunities. Not all of them. A couple of partners left along with a couple managers. Then earlier this month, I got the email that changed everything, a request for a job interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was nervous. It had been a while since I interviewed, I would liken the experience to a date. The atmosphere was professional, and I got to speak with 3 of the partners along with an admin lead. I was open and honest with them about everything. When asked why I was looking for another job, I told them the truth. I was looking for something with more career growth and clear track to partner.  I did not even realize until asked the question in the interview that I was not only upset about the money. My track for partner was now gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after, I received the job offer for exactly what I was wanting! I approached my legacy lead partner the next day. I remained open and honest and explained my situation. I received another job offer. I needed more money. I asked if he would match. We chatted about the opportunity and my concerns and then he told me he would get back with me. He got back with me within 20 minutes. The firm will match! I was elated! I let the other firm know what had taken place (I was again honest and communicated to them that I was staying at my current firm). No hard feelings, they said to let them know if anything changes. I'm blessed beyond measure!

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is interested, I am considering a follow up on this post next year. From what I've seen on reddit, most people who stay at a place with a matched offer typically get put on the chopping block (Does anyone know if there is any statistical backup on this?). I would like to think I fall in the small % that will remain happily employed. Due to the nature of my work and client relationships, I *am* replaceable. However, I *am* expensive to replace.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR - Was told that the firm could not offer me what I wanted for my raise this year, would take a couple of years to see it. Got an offer for what I was asking for from another firm. My firm matched!**

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long time lurker, first time posting in this subreddit. I wanted to share my latest experience with my career, anonymously. This is more of me getting this off of my chest and less seeking any advice or answers. It is a bit of a long read and is 100% based on what I went through the later part of this year. Read on at your discretion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will start by saying I love my job, coworkers, clients &amp;amp; even my bosses. It feels more like a hobby and I honestly can&amp;#39;t wait to start my working days. I&amp;#39;m also enthusiastically working towards partner. That being said, I recognize that I&amp;#39;m working to provide a good life for my family first. Period. My firm went through a recent merger, significantly increasing in size (think mid-size firm, to large firm). In October, I spoke with the lead partner of the legacy firm on my raise (goes into effect 1/1/2024) and bonus for 2023. Bonus was in line with previous years so all OK there. Raise was not in line with previous years. You&amp;#39;ll never guess which direction the raise went (If you guessed down, you were right). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to negotiate for a better raise and was politely shut down. I was told the new firm would be able to afford a bigger annual raise for everyone moving forward and this was the best they could offer. I was frustrated. I had planned to bat for myself this year and had a specific $ amount in mind. With the weirdness surrounding the recent merger, my planned negotiation went sideways. I projected my salary with raises forward and found it would take two more years to get what I was asking for. Other coworkers were just as disappointed as I was. One good thing to note, the rest of the benefit package (namely insurance), was a LOT better than the previous firm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told they would pay out our PTO balance. The firm was not required to by law so it was nice to hear we would get something (although we do have some full remote employees who live in states that protect their employees from employers not wanting to pay out their benefits package. In this case, they were entitled to EVERY hour they had accrued). Then the PTO email goes out to each of us. After discussing with coworkers, we quickly found that &amp;quot;policy&amp;quot; would not allow ALL hours to be paid out. Our feelings of disappointed frustration escalated to livid ire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partners had conversations with each of us to discuss our thoughts on the PTO payout and policy. A lot of coworkers were open and honest with them on how they felt. I was too.

jobs,"I love my job so ill keep it very vague
My manager is very close friends with coworker A from before A was with the company. There has been favoritism from the start, i completely understand that and dont hold any grudge for it, its human nature. 
A made mistakes working with me in the past that I brought to the manager very gently and A and I haven’t interacted much since.
 A recent seems to have a grudge against me. A has been going behind me and blaming me for random issues, and using me as a scapegoat. But all this time A hasnt reached out to me once, neither has my manager. Its radio silence.
More then once because of this I have been shamed or called out in group meetings for these mistakes without being given an option to defend myself, its made to seem like this was all decided on, but im being hit by this out of no where. I feel like I cant defend myself. A is also purposely not looking in the camera when speaking to me. And my manager bringing these issues he hasnt even discussed with me once up in these all departmentt meetings is leaving me blindsided.
I again love my job, but what do I do, ive never once been mean to A, ive been nothing but nice. And i really respected my manager for his integrity, but him not reaching out, and bringing this up in big meetings but not to me personally where I can talk it out, it feels pointed

My manager is very close friends with coworker A from before A was with the company. There has been favoritism from the start, i completely understand that and dont hold any grudge for it, its human nature. 
A made mistakes working with me in the past that I brought to the manager very gently and A and I haven’t interacted much since.
 A recent seems to have a grudge against me. A has been going behind me and blaming me for random issues, and using me as a scapegoat. But all this time A hasnt reached out to me once, neither has my manager. Its radio silence.
More then once because of this I have been shamed or called out in group meetings for these mistakes without being given an option to defend myself, its made to seem like this was all decided on, but im being hit by this out of no where. I feel like I cant defend myself. A is also purposely not looking in the camera when speaking to me. And my manager bringing these issues he hasnt even discussed with me once up in these all departmentt meetings is leaving me blindsided.
I again love my job, but what do I do, ive never once been mean to A, ive been nothing but nice. And i really respected my manager for his integrity, but him not reaching out, and bringing this up in big meetings but not to me personally where I can talk it out, it feels pointed&lt;/p&gt;

jobs,"Hi all,

I posted in this thread a couple days ago about how getting fired back in February absolutely [ruined me](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/18jk8lt/getting_fired_caused_me_to_lose_all_interest_in/).

I spent between February-August in a state of shock and misery, bouncing between full days in bed and the literal hospital.

Started tentatively applying for new jobs in September and now have finally landed one. It's kind of similar tasks to my old job (event programming), and something I know I would have been interested in at the start of my career, but it's definitely not a replacement of what was my capital D ""Dream Job.""

I know I need a job to survive...I'm almost 30 and want to move out of my parent's house. I also feel like maybe being on my own again and re-engaging with society could help me feel better.

But I'm terrified to re-start the 9-5 life. I am still struggling with severe depression (I have both a therapist and psych), but above all have completely lost my motivation and drive that I previously had. I don't feel passion or joy anymore. It's difficult for me to show up on time anywhere, and I fear I've lost all the strong organization and detail oriented skills I had before that made me so marketable.

Any advice on how to move forward?
